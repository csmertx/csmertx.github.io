RPi4 = Raspberry Pi 4
I wanted a tiny console to check out ARM architecture stuff: Ubuntu/RPi4, and RetroPie/RPi4.
This one does not include a parts list because this configuration (power delivery hat/addon) killed the official RPi4 LCD screen. I sold my RPi4 because of sketchy hats (addon boards). Next attempt will be something different.</description></item><item><title>Wrist Rests (2020)</title><link>https://csmertx.github.io/Blog/stuff/2023/silicone_wrist_rests/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csmertx.github.io/Blog/stuff/2023/silicone_wrist_rests/</guid><description>Supplies delivered: March 3, 2020
I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to keep these posts to the point and to not go crazy with the details. At the end of 2020 I stumbled in to some remote contract work. This job required the use of a keyboard, and a lot of typing. Instead of spending time and money on future RSI surgeries, I decided to get an urklenomic keyboard. The problem with the keyboard I bought (aside from the price tag) was that my wrists would go numb after four hours.</description></item></channel></rss>
