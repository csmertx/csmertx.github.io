I made a paint holder out of epoxy sculpt that secured the little 0.25oz/7.4ml square bottles. Switching out bottles was a chore due to the finish and design. So I made this with Fusion 360 to alleviate those gripes. Unfortunately, I never included bolt threading in the design due to a non-existent time crunch. This might seem like overkill, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather spend this amount on something to hold the paint than to replace carpet(s).</description></item><item><title>Pen Cup</title><link>https://csmertx.github.io/Blog/stuff/2023/pencup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csmertx.github.io/Blog/stuff/2023/pencup/</guid><description>Created: March 10, 2022
One of my guilty pleasure hobbies is skateboarding with my fingers. I was never average at skateboarding and Florida has a lot of summer rain. Anyway, I wanted my desk to look nicer, and so I made this thing. Used silver Testors model paint for the sign.

RPi4 = Raspberry Pi 4
I wanted a tiny console to check out ARM architecture stuff: Ubuntu/RPi4, and RetroPie/RPi4.
This one does not include a parts list because this configuration (power delivery hat/addon) killed the official RPi4 LCD screen. I sold my RPi4 because of sketchy hats (addon boards). Next attempt will be something different.</description></item><item><title>Wrist Rests</title><link>https://csmertx.github.io/Blog/stuff/2023/silicone_wrist_rests/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csmertx.github.io/Blog/stuff/2023/silicone_wrist_rests/</guid><description>Created: March 3, 2020
I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to keep these posts to the point and to not go crazy with the details. At the end of 2020 I stumbled in to some remote contract work. This job required the use of a keyboard, and a lot of typing. Instead of spending time and money on future RSI surgeries, I decided to get an urklenomic keyboard. The problem with the keyboard I bought (aside from the price tag) was that my wrists would go numb after four hours.</description></item></channel></rss>
