I made a paint holder out of epoxy sculpt that secured the little 0.25oz/7.4ml square bottles. Switching out bottles was a chore due to the finish and design. So I made this with Fusion 360 to alleviate those gripes. Unfortunately, I never included bolt threading in the design due to a non-existent time crunch.

I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to keep these posts to the point and to not go crazy with the details. At the end of 2020 I stumbled in to some remote contract work. This job required the use of a keyboard, and a lot of typing. Instead of spending time and money on future RSI surgeries, I decided to get an urklenomic keyboard.
