Switching out bottles was a chore due to the finish and design. So I made this with Fusion 360 to alleviate those gripes. Unfortunately, I never included bolt threading in the design due to a non-existent time crunch. This might seem like overkill, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather spend this amount on something to hold the paint than to replace carpet(s).</description></item><item><title>Quarter Pipe Pen Organizer</title><link>https://csmertx.github.io/Blog/stuff/2023/pencup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csmertx.github.io/Blog/stuff/2023/pencup/</guid><description> January 20, 2023 Created: 03-10-22 One of my guilty pleasure hobbies is skateboarding with my fingers.

My notes are at: Linux &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; RPi4
This one does not include a parts list because this configuration killed the official RPi4 LCD screen. I sold my RPi4 because of sketchy hats (addon boards). Next attempt will be something different (if there is another attempt).</description></item><item><title>Silicone Wrist Rests</title><link>https://csmertx.github.io/Blog/stuff/2023/silicone_wrist_rests/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csmertx.github.io/Blog/stuff/2023/silicone_wrist_rests/</guid><description>January 20, 2023 Created: 03-03-20 I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to keep these posts to the point and to not go crazy with the details. At the end of 2020 I stumbled in to some remote contract work. This job required the use of a keyboard, and a lot of typing.
