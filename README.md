My markdown will be a mess for at least the first quarter of 2022.  I have a few pages that need tending.  Please pardon my dust.

### TODO
- ~~gh-pages / Hugo~~
- Render notes from /content
- Go through larger notes to validate, and write in the last valid date.
- Expandable / collapsible menus for the sidebar
