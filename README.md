A few pages need tending.  Please pardon this messy plot of cyberspace.

### Update 07/23/2022
- This website may be moved to a different account in the future
- Some notes may be past their expiration date (obsolete)

### TODO
- ~~gh-pages / Hugo~~
- ~~Render notes from /content~~
- Edit notes so that the markdown is Github/Hugo compatible
- Go through larger notes to validate, and write in the last valid date.
- Expandable / collapsible menus for the sidebar
