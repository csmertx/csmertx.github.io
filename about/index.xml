There are some notes here that may help beginners, but mostly these notes are for quick access for when I revisit a project, or edge cases that were difficult to find a solution. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to remember to time stamp edits, but generally, github.com/csmertx will provide a better idea as to when a particular note was updated or created.</description></item></channel></rss>
