# CSx: Csmertx

> CSx is a CS hobby website with a little bin of fun mixed in with a little bit of documentation.

> Likes: 🔗 [Pork Cutlet Bowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-R5R59jiys "YouTube \ Deku's Katsudon from My Hero Academia - MIDORIYA'S FAVOURITE FOOD!?")

> My middle school Sharky nickname probably inspired by 🔗 [Sharky the Sharkdog](https://eekthecat.fandom.com/wiki/Sharky_the_Sharkdog "Eek! The Cat Wiki / Sharky Bartholomew Sharkdog III"). Or maybe because I skated until I was drenched in sweat. These days I'm known as Chris. Just Chris.

## Donation Button Clarification

My father dedicated over 20 years of his life to the military (Navy), which included a year long tour of Vietnam. He suffered through at least one fused vertebrae. Military (Florida) said it wasn't their problem. That's a big part why I am the way I am. And that's why I've included the link. I'm not pointing fingers, it just was what it was.
