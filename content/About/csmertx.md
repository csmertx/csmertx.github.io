# CSx: Csmertx

> CSx is a pet project website with a little bin of fun mixed in with a lot of RTFM. Mostly an easy way to check the notes from multiple devices--or from a family member's computer.

## Donation Button Clarification

> *This website is not an affiliated with the Wounded Warrior Project*

My father dedicated over 20 years of his life to the military (Navy), which included a year long tour of Vietnam. He suffered through at least one fused vertebrae. Military said it wasn't their problem. That's why I am the way I am. And that's why I've included the link.
