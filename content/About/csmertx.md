#### Purpose of this website
Storage space for notes and future projects.  Some of these notes may help Linux beginners, but most are for quick reference.


#### Gremlins?
grem·lin ˈgrem-lən
: a cause of error or equipment malfunction (as in aircraft) conceived of as a small mischievous gnome


#### About Me
My time with Linux started at the beginning of 2013. Computering with some kind of prompt since 1987. That said, my credentials are in my config files, so I am not an authority of computer science.  Regarding these notes--please take care.


#### What? No tiling window managers?

#### LGM.. like that one \*Insert Name Here\*
Nope, that's not it. Abbreviations may seem the same, but mine is mostly meme.

#### Skateboarding (1992 - 2005 & 2022 - ?)
Skateboarding is a part of my identity.  For those curious, here is more info.
- How skate decks are made (before bamboo and or carbon fiber skateboard decks):
    - https://skateboarding.transworld.net/news/skateboard-science/
- The 'Godfather' of street skating:
    - https://networthpost.org/net-worth/rodney-mullen-net-worth/
- I believe Rodeny Mullen (imagineer of the kickclip) spoke of Open Source and Linux in his TED Talk:
    - Rodney Mullen: Pop an ollie and innovate! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GVO-MfIl1Q
- 'Locals only' skateboard clubs are now obsolete
    - Braille Skateboarding https://www.youtube.com/user/sprocker7 (5.75M+ Subscribers)
- Why mention this here?
    - Stereotype roadblocks.  Speaking of stereos: Jason Lee (My Name Is Earl, Mallrats, etc.) is a professional skateboarder that rode for Blind Skateboards, and founded Stereo Skateboards.
