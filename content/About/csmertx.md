# Purpose of this website

Some of this documentation may help Linux beginners. There are a lot of examples that could be helpful, but I assume certain understandings about GNU/Linux that may be frustrating to newbies. I love researching topics, but I'm not that great at documenting my findings. I'm open to any mistakes glaring or otherwise found in this documentation. Thank you for visiting.

## csmertx?

My handle is portmanteau of ```c``` for my first initial, ```smert``` for a common mispronunciation of my surname, and ```x``` because of my experience working for Eckerd/CVS Pharmacy (like ```RX```). ```¯\_(ツ)_/¯```. Thankfully ```smert``` was already taken.

I created the handle before it was really common to see ```CS``` as an abbreviation for ```computer science```. So it goes.

## Gremlins?

> grem·lin ˈgrem-lən
> : a cause of error or equipment malfunction (as in aircraft) conceived of as a small mischievous gnome


## My history with Linux

My time with Linux started at the beginning of 2013. Computering with some kind of prompt since 1987. That said, my credentials are in my config files, so I am not an authority of computer science.  Regarding these notes--please take care.
