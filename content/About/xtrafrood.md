Yep, can do.  Please file a bug report or email xtrafrood (radio edit) gmail.com.

### Website Organization 
I found that I do better with trial by fire.  There will be future updates to group categories--the structure of the theme makes this task a process.

### Website useage hint
After clicking a sidebar link, pressing the back button will return to the previous scrolling point in the sidebar.  For the one person that may or may not have browsed this website: I'm sorry.  I'm doing my best to tend this plot of website.
