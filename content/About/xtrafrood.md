### Purpose of this website
An online home for all my notes, and future projects.

### Shorthand used in the notes (& ~/.bashrc aliases)
- apti == sudo aptitude install
- aptr == sudo aptitude remove
- sudov == sudo vim (When I use anything else I leave behind random characters like: :wq)
- sudor == sudo ranger (Python based TUI file manager--not great for moving around lots of data, but perfect for the quickness)
- sudoc == sudo chmod +X (make script executable)
- bashrc == vim ~/.bashrc
- bashsrc == source ~/.bashrc
- TUI == Terminal User Interface
- GUI == Graphical User Interface
- AUR == Arch Linux User Repository (user supported repos--UAYOR)
- paci == sudo pacman -S
- pacr == sudo pacman -R
- tri == Trizen (Perl based AUR package manager--https://github.com/trizen/trizen)
- yay == Yay (AUT package manager that ships with EndeavourOS--https://github.com/Jguer/yay)

### Errors?
Yep, can do.  Please file a bug report or email xtrafrood (radio edit) gmail.com.

### Website Organization 
There will be future updates to group categories--the structure of the theme makes this task a process.  Timestamps included look like this (220308), because that's how I timestamp filenames (March 8, 2022).  Still working on unifying Markdown syntax.

### Website useage hint
After clicking a sidebar link, pressing/swiping/clicking Back (or: Left Alt + Left Arrow) will return to the previous scrolling point in the sidebar.  For the one person that may or may not have browsed this website: I'm sorry.  I'm doing my best to tend this plot of website.
