### Refactored website layout

I'm not sure if I want to bother with RSS. If so, then this website layout may change again in the future. Super stoked how the collapsible menus look. That was my reasoning behind picking the [Geekdocs theme](https://geekdocs.de/). Also added a spot to share random music hosted on YouTube. As I update my CD collection I'll share more songs. CDs are so much easier to deal with compared to vinyl--I can't tell the difference between .mp3 and .flac formats anyway. This lil blog is also a way for me to keep my social media accounts and post elsewhere. Wait out the ad-pocalpyse over in this little corner of cyberspace and whatnot.

### Legacy WinXP devices via modern PCs

A few years ago I built a persistent Arch Linux system to run off a USB drive. I needed a way to connect a VCR2DVD device with drivers only for Windows XP to a modern computer. Why not Windows XP from a USB drive? It boots to Linux, and loads a virtualized copy of Windows XP physical access to modern USB ports. And now it's time to build the system again (it's not for me). Why not build it and talk about it when it's finished? Extra motivation to document the process and finish it in the next week or two I guess?
