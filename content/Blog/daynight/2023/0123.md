### Refactored website layout

I'm not sure if I want to bother with RSS. If so, then this website layout may change again in the future. Super stoked how the collapsible menus look. That was my reasoning behind picking the [üîó Geekdocs theme](https://geekdocs.de/). Also added a spot to share random music hosted on YouTube. As I update my CD collection I'll share more songs. CDs are so much easier to deal with compared to vinyl--I can't tell the difference between .mp3 and .flac formats anyway. This lil blog is also a way for me to keep my social media accounts and post elsewhere. Wait out the ad-pocalpyse over in this little corner of cyberspace and whatnot.

### Legacy WinXP devices via modern PCs

A few years ago I built a persistent Arch Linux system to run off a USB drive. I needed a way to connect a VCR2DVD device with drivers only for Windows XP to a modern computer. Why not Windows XP from a USB drive? It boots to Linux, and loads a virtualized copy of Windows XP with physical access to modern USB ports. And now it's time to build the system again (it's not for me). Why not build it and talk about it when it's finished? Extra motivation to document the process and finish it in the next week or two I guess?

### Less personal posts, and more technical posts

Booting Arch Linux off a USB drive with a specific laptop is not going all that well. It's funny how much things change in only a few years. If only I knew what I did two years ago to make it all work. WinXP legacy devices.. Tried Debian stable earlier, and now trying Ubuntu 22.04 Server. If that doesn't work I'll look at other options. I'll keep the too much information (TMI) blog posts up, because there's no one to spray me with a garden hose.

### Spelling and Grammar

I guess it all depends on your perspective. I know I can do better, and I'll try my darndedest. I really want ArchXP to be a thing. How cool would that be? Not cool at all but still. Arch Linux, USB drive, sometime in the next year. Let's go.

### Fishing and PFAS

[üîó Eating one wild fish same as month of drinking [PFAS] tainted water: study](https://phys.org/news/2023-01-wild-fish-month-tainted.html)


[üîó U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuges System: ECDMS4Wildlife & Environmental Contaminants Mapper](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecdms4/)

This is why we can't have nice wild caught fish for dinner.

### Music Blog Posts

Just for fun. Most are from my own collection, and addressing the Samurai Champloo Music Record entry: I just like the music. When I first watched the Samurai Champloo series, I was buying vinyl records from the Definitive Jux record label. Nujabes fit the style of music I was diving in to at the time and really encouraged me in to become a fan of the anime.

### Github-Pages Test

Added a new bug report for the markdown formatting mess. I also configured Visual Studio Code with Github markdown extension. It'll be a little bit, but I doubt that more than 13 people visit this site, so in theory few will be affected as I break the website in the process. I'm just guessing, I have no accurate way to tell who is viewing what on the website. Consistent cloning though, so that's cool.

### Github-Pages Success

I updated the Music Blog with a song from an American band I've appreciated since the early 00s, and deployment (converting markdown to HTML) failed. Deployments continued to fail until I removed the name of a certain country that just happens to be part of the band name. Post rock? I like guitar sounds. Which reminds me: [üîó YouTube | Ronald Jenkees - Guitar Sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smE-uIljiGo). I guess github-pages also scrapes and analyzes website link titles, because it kept failing until I removed the YouTube link to the song (Death Rides a Horse). I've always been a fan of the 'underdogs', so I hope it's clear that I do not support what's happening--I just didn't expect github-pages to be so selective.

### IRL Designs blog

Everything is a blog or Vlog these days c'mon. I made some stuff in the past two years, so I thought why not include them as well right? Two can be printed (STLs included), one can be casted, and the other can be purchased. RPi4 Console parts list not included because the configuration zapped my official 7in RPi LCD screen. So it goes. The Day & Night title of this blog subsection has little to do with the lyrics of the Kid Cudi song Day 'N' Night. I do like the beat and atmosphere of that song though.

### The Tunnel

I'm going to take a moment to be brutally honest with myself for all the public to see. I have no job. No career. No five year plan. No job references. No letter of recommendation. No vehicle. I'm staying in a family member's storage room an hour away from the city I know. I'm afraid of parties. I'm 38, and I have no friends. Also, I'm not as good as a writer as I once thought. What I do have going for me is that I stopped drinking wine and vaping cannabis several months ago, and I don't buy snacks, energy drinks, or fast food. When I worked retail I needed two energy drinks (red bull) a day just to keep up with appearances. Now I drink tea or coffee (when I can afford unroasted beans). I'm also making just enough with 'side hustles' to pay my bills. I'd like to pursue a career as a cloud architect, though my work history, personality, and reputation say otherwise. There we go, mask off, and neck revealed.

### Professionalism

I have Visual Studio Code configured with Vim emulation and the markdown renderer set for [üîó Github Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-github-flavored-markdown-). I guess it's time to start working on the markdown formatting of this website. Probably didn't have to file a bug report, but it's decent practice.
