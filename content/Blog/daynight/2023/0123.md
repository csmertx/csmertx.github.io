### Refactored website layout

I'm not sure if I want to bother with RSS. If so, then this website layout may change again in the future. Super stoked how the collapsible menus look. That was my reasoning behind picking the [Geekdocs theme](https://geekdocs.de/). Also added a spot to share random music hosted on YouTube. As I update my CD collection I'll share more songs. CDs are so much easier to deal with compared to vinyl--I can't tell the difference between .mp3 and .flac formats anyway. This lil blog is also a way for me to keep my social media accounts and post elsewhere. Wait out the ad-pocalpyse over in this little corner of cyberspace and whatnot.

### Legacy WinXP devices via modern PCs

A few years ago I built a persistent Arch Linux system to run off a USB drive. I needed a way to connect a VCR2DVD device with drivers only for Windows XP to a modern computer. Why not Windows XP from a USB drive? It boots to Linux, and loads a virtualized copy of Windows XP with physical access to modern USB ports. And now it's time to build the system again (it's not for me). Why not build it and talk about it when it's finished? Extra motivation to document the process and finish it in the next week or two I guess?

### A note for Runes of Magic (MMORPG)

First of all, if you're unaware of the game I'd advise caution. The game was designed to psychologically extract money from people. Welcome to the world of 2009 and free to play video game titles right?

It was the beginning of 2013, the world still turned regardless of the trumpeted songs sung by the 2012 end of the world conspiracy theorists. Anyway, most conspiracy theories are just ploys to sell merchandise. I was terrible at navigating, unemployed, and was looking for a way to be more of a team player. I had spent the last three years working at a tiny gas station near i75--two of those years I worked the overnight shift. As a console player I developed an appreciation for RPGs, which later grew in an appreciation for MMORPGs (like World of Warcraft). And so I went on the hunt for a free to play (F2P) RPG. That's how I found Runes of Magic. Nothing romantic like a friend handing me a physically copy of the game in 2009. Nope, a simple Google search, and within a few hours I was playing the game. I'll skip all the mundane details of the story--thousands of hours of mundane details.

It took me a few attempts to figure things out. I'll be honest, my first attempt was a disaster. In the first week of playing I was called a nub--which means a longtime player that still hasn't figured things out--and I was trolled more times than I can count. On my second attempt, which was probably a year after the first attempt, I had a lot more fun. Sure, I hopped around from guild to guild, but it was a great way to talk to a lot of different people (some were the same people with different characters). We traded stories, I read of the golden day days of RoM stories, and things were pretty great. I opted not to use a microphone, so all my communication was via keyboard. The trouble started when I said something really stupid to one of my in game friends. She (?) obviously did not appreciate what I said, and that's when the fun sort of stopped. What I said wasn't necessarily bad, it was more of the context of what I said. I still feel terrible, and wish I could take it back, but that's not how things work. It seemed like every time I logged in people teased her, so I decided it was time for me to leave. I flash sold all of my gear 90-95% off, and deleted every character on all five accounts.

Moving right along from 2016 to 2018. I was listening to a lot of Linux podcasts soaking in all the details I could, but I needed something to keep my hands busy. Why not hop on Runes of Magic for an hour or two a day? As long as I wasn't playing 12-16 hours a day it wouldn't be a big deal right? For the first year or two I said nothing. I kept to myself, and whenever someone offered a guild invite I would reply with "nty". All my replies and conversations were in the form of "ty" or "nty". I was very cautious, and even ignored duel invites.

In 2022 I opened up a bit more, and had more conversations. There were moments in which I thought the past was talking to me about something. Someone would say something that would catch my attention. But who was saying what? I have no idea. By 2022 I no longer recognized any of the character names. There had been a few server merges since 2016, and one server merge merged the U.S. American server with a few servers from across the pond. The auction house price of gear was nearly doubling every 365 days, and the server population was decreasing. Guilds were disappearing, and the poor souls that had questions in chat were ridiculed for being ignorant. Not even those with questions--some shouts for lower level instances (LFG) were ridiculed. I can't remember how many levels I needed to reach lvl 100/100 (dual class system). Was it twenty? Anyway, in October of 2022 RoM had an experience and talent point event which doubled rewards for turning in quests (2.5x?). So I screencasted buying daily quest reset tickets with gold, and using those tickets to get both sides of my character to 100/100. Since October 2022, I have had a folder with 300GB of 1080p screencast footage of me playing Runes of Magic. It's probably obvious by my Github activity that I'm not a popular guy. I'm not the type to rally the troups into battle or whatever. I mean, I attended one siege war in my four years--and I was ignored when I said I had merits for siege war upgrades. So I know that even though I rewatched all the footage, took notes, and then sliced up individual clips to be strung together later, I doubt I'll have more than 100 views for the video. It feels like I would be wasting everyone's valuable time. I'm not sure I have the heart to even try to finish that video. I solo'd Runes of Magic. That was the idea behind the video--how I solo'd a MMORPG. Anyway, I wish I could continue to play, but I don't have the patience for that game anymore. At the moment I don't even have the patience to finish editing that video.

I guess I needed to get this out in the open. To those that were genuine and helpful in the game I wish you the best. I tried to run a character through some daily quests recently and literally posted in world chat "I can't do this" before logging out. I'm no longer keeping tabs on the server status through Discord, and I'm not even sure I can play another MMORPG. I just can't do it anymore. And now I feel kind silly about posting this blog post. Who is going to read this? Statistically speaking probably no one that has ever played Runes of Magic. I remember listening to a podcast that dove into The Sims Online community, and what it was like in the moments before they pulled the plug on the server. The last day of Runes of Magic might not be as heartfelt--probably more like a 20 year high school reunion--but still, I hope it's a good one.

### Less personal posts, and more technical posts

Booting Arch Linux off a USB drive with a specific laptop is not going all that well. It's funny how much things change in only a few years. If only I knew what I did two years ago to make it all work. WinXP legacy devices.. Tried Debian stable earlier, and now trying Ubuntu 22.04 Server. If that doesn't work I'll look at other options. I'll keep the too much information (TMI) blog posts up, because there's no one to spray me with a garden hose.

### Spelling and Grammar

I guess it all depends on your perspective. I know I can do better, and I'll try my darndedest. I really want ArchXP to be a thing. How cool would that be? Not cool at all but still. Arch Linux, USB drive, sometime in the next year. Let's go.

### Fishing and PFAS

This is why we can't have nice wild caught fish for dinner.

### Music Blog Posts

Just for fun. Most are from my own collection, and addressing the Samurai Champloo Music Record entry: I just like the music. When I first watched the Samurai Champloo series, I was buying vinyl records from the Definitive Jux record label. Nujabes fit the style of music I was diving in to at the time and really encouraged me in to become a fan of the anime.

### Github-Pages Test

Added a new bug report for the markdown formatting mess. I also configured Visual Studio Code with Github markdown extension. It'll be a little bit, but I doubt that more than 13 people visit this site, so in theory few will be affected as I break the website in the process. I'm just guessing, I have no accurate way to tell who is viewing what on the website. Consistent cloning though, so that's cool.

### Github-Pages Success

I updated the Music Blog with a song from an American band I've appreciated since the early 00s, and deployment (converting markdown to HTML) failed. Deployments continued to fail until I removed the name of a certain country that just happens to be part of the band name. Post rock? I like guitar sounds. Which reminds me: [Ronald Jenkees - Guitar Sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smE-uIljiGo). I guess github-pages also scrapes and analyzes website link titles, because it kept failing until I removed the YouTube link to the song (Death Rides a Horse). I've always been a fan of the 'underdogs', so I hope it's clear that I do not support what's happening--I just didn't expect github-pages to be so selective.
