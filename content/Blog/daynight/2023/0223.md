### Markup Quality Assurance

I'll admit it, my access to the internet should be revoked. I think I may have 75% of the pages edited and ready to be pushed upstream. I feel like if I don't at least shout into the void, I may go crazy. So if there's ever a wonder as to why I created a blog for a website of little consequence--well--there it is.

I know, creating an issue within my own project and merging my own fix is against the natural order of open source. I'm surprised it's even allowed by Microsoft.. err.. Github. Right, I'm not sure how many pages I have left to edit. I'll dedicate a full day to go over as much as I can, add some links and whatnot, but I can't guarantee that all the niche notes will be current. I have SOME spare time, but not enough to check every command and reinstall every operating system. I mean, by my various gods, attempting to install all the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) systems again would take up an entire 40 hour work week. As would a single Arch Linux, or Slackware system.

I'll be honest, that gif above reminds me of how I feel about dating. Back when The Office (US) first aired, I was in a long distance online relationship. Which is probably way more popular in 2023. It only lasted a year, because I was way too immature for her. Webcams, microphones, text messaging, eating instant ramen to save for flights to Toronto. I learned that I really like snow. I also saw how my hair is suppose to look for the first time. Hard water sure is a thing here in Florida. A lot of firsts happened like riding in a subway car. Ok, time for more page edits. This markup won't format itself.

Going over all the pages again to make sure formatting is as unified as possible. I hope all the website clonings are from bots scanning repositories for sensitive data. Because damn, I put a lot of myself in to this website, it would take a lot to take it all out just for copy pasta. Anyway, off I go again--sweepin' up tea leaves--making sure the website is as presentable as possible.
