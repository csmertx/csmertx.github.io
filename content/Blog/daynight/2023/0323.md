### Coffee at night?

Still waiting for Google to crawl this site and finish the webpage indexing. Added a Hugo entry in the Web category that includes the steps I took to link this Github page with Google Search Console. It's really not that complicated. And I'd be lying if I said thinking about my recently borked Thinkpad didn't sting my psyche a little. On the plus side, I might step into the world of Apple for a little while and see how the water feels. Maybe I'll splash around a bit and see what happens.

Updated [FFmpeg](/Linux/Software/ffmpeg) to include how to batch crop images with [XnConvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert). I guess my current situation is better than hunting for jobs on a strict diet of baked potatoes.

They say you reap what you sow--not sure paying half the rent/utilities from the couch for eight months or all the rent/utilities for a year entitled me to a strict diet of potatoes (pre-2013 'karma'). Thankfully I'll never have to go through that again. Perhaps it's time to learn how to tie a tie.

I posted a song by Ratatat called Seventeen Years in [Music Blog](/Blog/music/2023/0323) for March 2023. I feel like I shouldn't have to say this, because I've been an adult since 2003, but I didn't write the song Seventeen Years. The music was created by Ratatat (lyrics by Young Churf). The video was created by a bunch of talented artists. The premise of the video is about rainforest deforestation, habitation destruction, and the effects it has on the planet. Raccoons seem to be globally recognized creatures, so it makes sense they were used in the video instead of Toucan Sam or King Kong.

I guess I have another story to tell after all. When I was ten I helped Dad build a fenced in area for a garden. Which sounds normal right? Wild animals eat unprotected produce all the time. So, I chopped down all the small crab apple trees required (by myself) with a normal sized axe, cut the trees to length, and then we assembled the fence. I wanted to cut down more trees, because that's fun right? No access to 90s cable TV type boredom. I guess I was posturing during a conversation, so Dad bet me that I couldn't cut down a medium sized oak tree that was way to close to the house. Just a prideful bet.

Naturally, I woke up early the next morning and spent six hours chopping into that oak tree. Did I mention it was close to the house? What happened next was like a scene out of that show the Beverly Hillbillies. The tree nearly took out the bay window on the side of our double wide mobile home. We lived within biking distance of a pond, and Dad couldn't drive anymore due to reasons, so that was cool.

The town was so tiny that the middle school was also a high school (grades 6-12..). The magnet program for that school was agricultural, which included real life cows. Not at a nearby pasture, there was a literal cow pasture attached to the side of the high school. Like, people showed up to class in literal cowboy boots (lots of rattlesnakes in Hawthorne, FL). Instead of this example of a morning announcement: "the owner of the blue Corolla left their lights on", morning announcements where more like: "the owner of the blue chevy left a shotgun in their gun rack". I went to both types of schools, and the same inflection was used for either announcement.

What's my point? I don't have one. Also, I never developed a fear for dentists. That's not it.
