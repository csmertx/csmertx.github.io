Still waiting for Google to crawl this site and finish the webpage indexing. Added a Hugo entry in the Web category that includes the steps I took to link this Github page with Google Search Console. It's really not that complicated. And I'd be lying if I said thinking about my recently borked Thinkpad didn't sting my psyche a little. On the plus side, I might step into the world of Apple for a little while and see how the water feels. Maybe I'll splash around a bit and see what happens.

Updated [FFmpeg](/Linux/Software/ffmpeg) to include how to batch crop images with [XnConvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert). I guess my current situation is better than hunting for jobs on a strict diet of baked potatoes. They say you reap what you sow--not sure paying half the rent/utilities from the couch for eight months or all the rent/utilities for a year entitled me to a strict diet of potatoes (pre-2013 'karma'). Thankfully I'll never have to go through that again. Perhaps it's time to learn how to tie a tie.
