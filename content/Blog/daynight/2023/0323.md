Still waiting for Google to crawl this site and finish the webpage indexing. Added a Hugo entry in the Web category that includes the steps I took to link this Github page with Google Search Console. It's really not that complicated. And I'd be lying if I said thinking about my recently borked Thinkpad didn't sting my psyche a little. On the plus side, I might step into the world of Apple for a little while and see how the water feels. Maybe I'll splash around a bit and see what happens.
