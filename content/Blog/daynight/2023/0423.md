### Courage to close one's eyes

I haven't had a slice of honest to goodness Italian American pizza in many.. well.. let's not make this awkward and just say it's been a minute and leave it at that. All the hype about the new Soup-r Mare-e-o brothers movie reminded me of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! (1989), and the Super Mario Bros. movie (1993). That cartoon and that movie were both cucumbers. Not as bad as those really awful videos of people scaring their cats with zucchinis and cucumbers, but dang. The cartoon Genie of the Lamp wouldn't even grant a plumber a wish without some coin. And what was going on with those power boots from the movie? The Goombas? The fungus amongus? Sheesh.

When my folks first moved to Florida my Mom worked at a local pizza parlor (it was the 80s..), and the daycare center I stayed at was actually just the kids play place at the restaurant. The owners wanted the restaurant to be ultra kid friendly, so there was a kids area to watch cartoons and play with toys. I think there was a small arcade too? My introduction to pizza in the states was pretty tasty.

I may have some work lined up. I didn't even need the fancy webcam and my overpriced shirt and tie (glad I have them tho). Hopefully some new projects will be in the works soon-ish rather than later-ish. I don't feel or act like myself when I feel like I'm not doing my share of the work. It's a weird catch 22 during interviews.

A guy that once rode his bike 10 miles to work in the Florida heat due to the city buses being unreliable can't get a job he's totally qualified for, because he's ashamed of himself, and that shame shows during his interviews. Whether or not the interviewee reads the mood as shame or not doesn't matter. The appearance of shame is the appearance of failure. Or in practical terms: two weeks of training waisted. Why wouldn't they hire a college student? I mean, this gray haired guy doesn't even have community service on his resume. And wow, the places on his resume don't even exist anymore. What's that about? And no references?! Yikes.

thanks for reading
