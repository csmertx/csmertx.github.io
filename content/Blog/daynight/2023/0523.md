With the assistance of [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/#demo) I updated the artwork for this website. [MC Gremlin](https://github.com/csmertx/csmertx.github.io/commit/1a13b9223f6976db6b51e7e8be2f1f08ba27c281#diff-954dc96c8f205806bdc1625a58ccb22135c6d4a575de73783fac1e5e0fc1ef9d) (yep, named it) is like a gothic gremlin or something I don't know. The premise of this website is based off the WWII gremlins like [Gus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gremlins), and not necessarily famous gremlins from famous 90s movies, so I changed the logo.

Anyone else remember Zero Bars? Are those like the pineapple pizzas of the candy world? I feel like all my favorites are equivalent to Hawaiian style pizzas. I also feel like authentic Hawaiian style pizza is topped with Spam instead of Canadian bacon. Maybe some anchovies too--what? What are you looking at? Never seen a grown man eat pizza topped with apples from a pine tree before? C'mon dude, let a person live already.
