With the assistance of [Stable Diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/#demo) I updated the artwork for this website. [MC Gremlin](https://github.com/csmertx/csmertx.github.io/commit/1a13b9223f6976db6b51e7e8be2f1f08ba27c281#diff-954dc96c8f205806bdc1625a58ccb22135c6d4a575de73783fac1e5e0fc1ef9d) (yep, named it) is like a gothic gremlin or something I don't know. The premise of this website is based off the WWII gremlins like [Gus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gremlins), and not necessarily famous gremlins from famous 90s movies, so I changed the logo.

Anyone else remember Zero Bars? Are those like the pineapple pizzas of the candy world? I feel like all my favorites are equivalent to Hawaiian style pizzas. I also feel like authentic Hawaiian style pizza is topped with Spam instead of Canadian bacon. Maybe some anchovies too--what? What are you looking at? Never seen a grown man eat pizza topped with apples from a pine tree before? C'mon dude, let a person live already.

### Pull saw

</div><br />

Just two more blades, a handle for the blades, and a bunch of other stuff to go. The blade shown is for flush cutting wooden pegs.

The benefit of going the pull saw route is that once I'm done looking silly for the neighbors, I can use the tools to dovetail all kinds of things, including very small pieces of walnut wood to make small boxes. The blades are 0.5mm thick, which is suppose to be awesome for fine detail work.

Anyway, that's it for now. Time for me to play more Pinball FX3.
