I may have found something interesting to tinker with, but for the moment I thought I'd share my workflow for this pet project website. You see, there was a Vim markdown document preview issue that inspired me to try VSCode #nerdtree4life. Anyway, till next time

Visual Studio Code(receipts):

```
Challenger Deep Theme, Code Spell Checker, Dracula Official Theme (current), GitHub Markdown Preview, Markdown Checkboxes, Markdown Emoji, Markdown Footnotes, Markdown Preview GitHub Styling, Markdown Preview Mermaid Support, Markdown yaml Preamble, Remote - SSH, Remote - SSH: Editing Configuration Files, Remote Explorer, Vim (vscodevim)
```
