### How to peel an orange with a sim card tool

> "The Girl Who Came Home", is the only book on the 2READ pile that I haven't read already. Pretty sure I read at least 50 of the first series Goosebumps books before 1998. It's all about the embossing tbh.

Still zooming along with Kubuntu 23.04 as my main operating system. My side hustle might not make me rich, but it hasn't been interrupted by any technical difficulties. Though it would be irresponsible of me not to mention that 23.04 is NOT a long term release OS, and it is running on a tried and tested Thinkcentre M73 (w/pupgrades). Best case scenario sans running an Nvidia Quadro K620 in 2023 (oof? oof.).

Fossil FTW7074 Update:

It's fine. Still loses Bluetooth signal while the phone is less than 3FT away. Possibly caused by my Avantree Oasis bluetooth transmitter. Sometimes making it difficult to set different timers. Yep, ÂµAlexa requires an uplink to a server to function, go figure right?

I've also been secretly working on isolating a ground loop crackle coming from the M73. It travels up the stereo cable from the PC, through the two channel Just Mixer headphone mixer, and through the transmitter to my bluetooth headphones. The obvious choice is to buy a decent sound card, which I will probably do once I open it up the M73 again and see how the PCIE cards are arranged. I figured it's a ground loop issue because I can stop it by placing my hand on the connector housing of the input cable connected to the mixer (hand on mixer make work good). It might just be a bad cable, but in this instance, I have a good excuse to buy a new sound card.

I know I'm caught up in nostalgia hype, and Gen-Z'rs are most likely profiting off my youth, but for a few seconds the other day I could imagine what it was like to walk out of the door of the family home in 1997. I could SMELL the open shed of .. bagged beverage cans as well. I guess the wind shifted during my recollection.
