### How to peel an orange with a sim card tool

<br />

> "The Girl Who Came Home", is the only book on the 2READ pile that I haven't read already. Pretty sure I read at least 50 of the first series Goosebumps books before 1998. It's all about the embossing tbh.

Still zooming along with Kubuntu 23.04 as my main operating system. My side hustle might not make me rich, but it hasn't been interrupted by any technical difficulties. Though it would be irresponsible of me not to mention that 23.04 is NOT a long term release OS, and it is running on a tried and tested Thinkcentre M73 (w/pupgrades). Best case scenario sans running an Nvidia Quadro K620 in 2023 (oof? oof.).

Fossil FTW7074 Hybrid Watch Update:

It's fine. Pressing the Alexa button and saying, "cancel timer", brings me to an nearly inescapable timer app. Which seems very unintuitive for a voice activated watch. The watch also still drops the Bluetooth signal while the phone is less than 3FT away. Possibly caused by my Avantree Oasis bluetooth transmitter. Sometimes making it difficult to set different timers. Yep, ÂµAlexa requires an uplink to a server to function, go figure right?

I've also been secretly working on isolating a ground loop crackle coming from the M73. It travels up the stereo cable from the PC, through the two channel Just Mixer headphone mixer, and through the transmitter to my bluetooth headphones. The obvious choice is to buy a decent sound card, which I will probably do once I open it up the M73 again and see how the PCIE cards are arranged. I figured it's a ground loop issue because I can stop it by placing my hand on the connector housing of the input cable connected to the mixer (hand on mixer make work good). It might just be a bad cable, but in this instance, I have a good excuse to buy a new sound card.

I know I'm caught up in nostalgia hype, and Gen-Z'rs are most likely profiting off my youth, but for a few seconds the other day I could imagine what it was like to walk out of the door of the family home in 1997. I could SMELL the open shed of .. bagged beverage cans as well. I guess the wind shifted during my recollection.

### Vim forever

<br />

I never knew [Bram Moolenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar) (creator of [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))). To be fair, I don't get out much, so that could be part of it. Though I can't speak of Moolenaar or of his character, I can say that Vim helped me organize my thoughts in a way I never thought possible. At this point in my late thirties, I'm nearly certain I have some form of attention deficit disorder. The major shift in organizing my life began in 2017 once I obtained confidence with Vim. The text editor melted away, and I could do what I wanted to do at the speed I wanted to do it.

There's a spot in my main Tmuxinator config file for a combination life journal and system maintenance log that I type in everyday (created: December 16, 2017 @ 6:13pm). Which was created using Vim, and updated using Vim. All the pet project scripts I've written since 2017 were created using Vim. It is one of the first programs I install on a new system, and it is the program I miss the most when I'm using Vi.

If I wasn't such a monster of a visual person, I would be using Vim to type this blog entry. Previewing markup files using Vim was not something I could do comfortably, so hopefully that explains my monstrosity. I have two documents that I edit everyday in Vim, and I will keep using Vim, whether it be from a terminal emulator, Termux, or Linux console.

I obviously really enjoy his creation, and I'm so sorry to have heard of his passing. RIP.

Mothballed two @csmertx social media accounts recently. The only websites I check anymore are Imgur and Facebook. For the piping hot Star Trek memes of course. And I do my best to avoid the mud thrown in the Red vs. Blue mudslinging match. It's a lot like dodging water balloons on the last day of high school (catapults .. ).

> The trick is the spot the airborne balloon, and assume it's not full of water..

And I tell you what, if you're looking for inexpensive jeans for work that are more durable than certain outdoor brands, look for surplus uniform jeans on Ebay. These sellers inspect, sort, and wash the pants (depending on the seller ofc). Mostly Redkap brand, which are also sold new through Amazon. What makes then better? Industrial grade stitching, extra belt loops, poly blend for stretch/cooling, and YKK zippers. Some spots included, but who cares? They're work pants.

Also, how do people just sit down and have a conversation with a virtual theater of people? Like, they just do that, and it's rad. I envy your ability to sit still long enough to make that happen. With so many words in the US English language, and so many dialects, and it all just rolls off your tongues. It's as easy to you as eating this slice of pizza is to me.
