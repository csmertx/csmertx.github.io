Kubuntu 23.04 on this upgraded Lenovo Thinkcentre M73 has been mostly positive. Same computer I use to work the side hustle, Jellyfin (10TB), and Nextcloud (500G). Developing this website too (lol). And it looks good on the 32-inch Samsung 4K monitor too ([HiDPI](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI) scaling @ 150%).

> Bought a dual monitor arm to eventually dual wield 2x 32-inch 4K monitors, but now I have regrets .. too much room for activities.

A few complications while switching resolutions, but that's most likely the increasing limitations of this here Nvidia K620. A quick restart resolves the complications. So it's up to me to secure a Quadro P620 before prices soar again.

Weird static noises showered through to my headphones without the Just Mixer attached to my janky two device one bluetooth headset setup. The inherent gain of the Just Mixer just boosts the noise. I'm not going to wear a static grounding wrist strap to make it stop, but there have been times when that seemed like the best solution. All this because I'll occasionally forget I'm wearing headphones. Comedy ensues when I pull the computer across the desk like a god dang mule pulling a load of turnips to market.

> Seriously, there was no intention with the album cover. It was on my mind because it was one of the first albums I listened to while playing Runes of Magic back in 2013. You know, like elevendy years ago. Do you know? Do you?
