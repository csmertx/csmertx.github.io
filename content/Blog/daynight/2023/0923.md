### Into the flame, into the fire

Kubuntu 23.04 on this upgraded Lenovo Thinkcentre M73 has been mostly positive. Same computer I use to work the side hustle, Jellyfin (10TB), and Nextcloud (500G). Developing this website too (lol). And it looks good on the 32-inch Samsung 4K monitor too ([HiDPI](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI) scaling @ 150%).

> Bought a dual monitor arm to eventually dual wield 2x 32-inch 4K monitors, but now I have regrets .. too much room for activities.

A few complications while switching resolutions, but that's most likely the increasing limitations of this here Nvidia K620. A quick restart resolves the complications. So it's up to me to secure a Quadro P620 before prices soar again.

> Soar like my heart right after the oatmeal drops the beat

Weird static noises showered through to my headphones without the Just Mixer attached to my janky two device one bluetooth headset setup. The inherent gain of the Just Mixer just boosts the noise. I'm not going to wear a static grounding wrist strap to make it stop, but there have been times when that seemed like the best solution. All this because I'll occasionally forget I'm wearing headphones. Comedy ensues when I pull the computer across the desk like a god dang mule pulling a load of turnips to market.

> Seriously, there was no intention with the album cover. It was on my mind because it was one of the first albums I listened to while playing Runes of Magic back in 2013. You know, like elevendy years ago. Do you know? Do you?

### Parasites

- [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parasite)

    Parasite
    ```: an organism living in, on, or with another organism in order to obtain nutrients, grow, or multiply often in a state that directly or indirectly harms the host```

<br />

Parasites are creatures that thrive on using others. They have very little regard for the host, and want only what is best for themselves, because anything less would be inconceivable. Their demands will be heard above the demands of all others at all costs, and they are void of dreams or goals because their needs have already been met. If they were human, they would probably laugh in the face of people that say they'll never retire.

> I'll never retire. When I finally scrape together a ten year domain for this website you can take that last line to the bank.

Calling someone a parasite is one of the lowest forms of insults. With a simple sentence a person is reduced to the least loved life forms on the planet. Which you might imagine is not fun for the person being called a parasite.

Have you ever envisioned what it would feel like to succumb to a tick invasion because you lack the dexterity required to pluck them off your skin? Parasites are terribly destructive creatures, and to be called one is enough to send someone down a spiral of self doubt and despair.

With that said, this desk that I'm typing from does not belong to me. I did not create Visual Studio Code, nor did I create the Hugo theme or framework that I use every time I update this website. And the majority of my pet projects are like mix tapes made from Stack Overflow answers.

> Though most of the code logic of my pet projects came from talking to Tux the Penguin. So technically, I owe all of my accomplishments to a masonite penguin statue.

I don't enjoy this lifestyle. If there was something I could focus on long enough to pull myself out of this, I would. From 2020-2022 I had a remote job and funneled most of my earnings into improving my 'office' so that I'm more prepared for future projects. And at the moment I am in between projects.

> Fun Fact: DSL connections can be maintained for hours during certain power outages by using a simple 300W UPS.

Actually, I was looking through old emails yesterday, which kind of gave me the idea for this blog post. In 2010, I applied to Walmart, Toys R Us, CVS, Target, and several other places, and never heard back. At the time I had at least five years of active retail experience, and had only month long gaps in employment. I was employed as a gas station 'attendant', and I applied to different jobs to pull myself out of working overnights for two years, but nothing came from my efforts.

> Fill out the two page job application, and submit. I'm not talking about jobs that require cover sheets or resumes here lol

People officially diagnosed with ADD might be able to spot the pattern. Or maybe spot the cycle of rejection. Not only from lack of employment, but also from family and friends that think I'm just not putting in the effort to pull my own weight. I think anyone that has browsed my Facebook page would know that I am all for working hard to accomplish a goal. When the goals are inaccessible is when the self doubt really starts to eat away at the smile that interviewers are expecting to see in the first place.

> It's not all bad though. Had I not gone through long term unemployment, I would not have the skills to have deployed this website. I tried Linux Mint in 2013 because I was bored to tears and tired of MS Windows. Actually, the truth is I was honestly convinced that Linux would outperform MS Windows. I mean, it's the framework for big name CGI tooling (Pixar).

During the first minute of interviews, I've witnessed an interviewer prop their head up with their hand, fold both arms and legs, and one interviewer casually asked me all the boiler plate worksheet questions without facing me. They were interviewing me for a position at one of the CVS stores I once helped to transition from an Eckerd Drug store to a CVS Pharmacy store. I knew how to do the job lol. One interviewer was ten minutes late to the interview because they decided to chat with a friend instead of interviewing me ("Maybe he'll just leave."). Another interviewer smiled sardonically throughout the interview. I guess I was a ridiculous candidate for cleaning snake cages. The only advice handed to me by a friend was to drive for Uber - completely bypassing my personality and recommending a job that would trigger migraines. I mean, I watched friends get jobs from other friends while I was stuck on the sidelines. I don't blame them, and I always appreciate feedback. ♫ *[Well, I guess this is growing up](https://genius.com/Blink-182-dammit-lyrics)* ♫

I worked as a unqualified HVAC mechanic for six months. The work was grueling, which was expected. Eventually you learn how to deal with the fiberglass dust that embeds itself everywhere. I loved using tin snips, brazing, and the fabrication side of the job, but the industry had different expectations of how to mentor people, and what methods should be employed to help others develop new skills. We were a residential team that specialized in replacing older HVAC systems, so I did get to see a lot of interesting ways of life.

> Gojo 957. Probably not great for the skin, but it helps when you're itching like you have parasites.

It's not that I don't know how interviews work, or that I'm not aware that I'm suppose to 'put my best foot forward', it's that they look me up and down and write me off as a small block of time that they will never get back. I am the waste of space occupying the chair that the last occupant used to brighten the interviewer's day.

> Blah, blah, blah. Fix my computer please.
