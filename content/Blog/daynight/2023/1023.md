If you spot 'I mean' being used ironically by people that have never attempted to play video games with European types it might have seemed somewhat odd. Shortening words and phrasing to be easily digestible for those with English as a second language might seem tedious and cumbersome, but it can be very beneficial to teams that take on people with a temporarily limited English vocabulary. According to [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=I%20mean), I mean can be pithy, but is usually just an exasperated way of dealing with what life throws at ya. I mean, here I am, writing in this blog right? Anyway, if someone has a problem with 'i mean', maybe suggest the nearest place where they can replace their very fine Oxford shoes. Maybe that's what is making them so irritable.

> Maybe it's all those fish and chips I've been hearing so much about .. lately.

And seriously, if these 'I hate I mean' types give you trouble for how your game character looks, they're just stuck in a mindset that would take a tragedy to break out of. And even that is not a guarantee. "Why me all the time" types might never learn from their own mistakes. Which is sort of heartbreaking, but that's just how it is sometimes.

> I'm not changing the physical attributes of my IG characters. Those features I spent IRL money on mean a lot to me.

I will never be a statically minded person, because there's always room for mental growth. Some people see this as a weakness, and that too is somewhat heartbreaking. This is why I tend to say the phrase or idiom: so it goes.

> This is the way. It is what it is. Them's the breaks. That's how the world works. It's a dog eat dog world out there.

Shout out to the people that took the time to write me back. I know I haven't been as emotionally available as others, and it meant a lot to me to just have a conversation with you all. Even though I'm captain awkward conversation man.

> Seriously, it meant a lot during trying times. Thank you for the boiled egg too.

Although I've built this website from a template created by someone else, I'd like to think that I took a prefabricated home and made it my own. Or maybe it's a 3D printed home; I'm not too sure on the specifications tbh.

> By a 3D printed home, I mean (lol) concrete composite homes that are uninhabitable because building codes take eons to update.

And oh boy do video games look pretty in 4K. Didn't think the Quadro P620 paired with a i7-4770 would be enough for games developed with 2004ish graphics (lol). Honestly, it's worth it to see colors outside the 80% sRGB range. Not to mention just being able to load a game without needing to drop down to 1080p resolution is neat as well. Something with a few more PCIE lanes, capture card, and 64GB-128GB RAM would be pretty sweet. Ten years of online PC gaming as a real boy and I'm thinking an actual gaming PC might be a worthwhile investment. I've been meaning to get back into 3D rendering and design, so maybe this will cause a cascade of adventuring. Sure does make those "can't sleep" MMORPG grind sessions a lot smoother.

> MMORPG grind sessions of me hopping around like a bunny because someone else noticed they can bypass the character loot animation saving 1 second of time per mob loot by jumping as they loot. I can do it for hours at a time because ADHD.

I haven't dug into the details as to why Jellyfin began dumping 20G+ of data into the $HOME/.config/jellyfin/config/transcode folder. Probably time to upgrade the main SSD beyond 512G. I was watching Ant-Man and a popup appeared telling me that I was running out of storage space. Probably should have Nextcloud on a third SSD. I assumed setting aside a 120GB chunk would be enough to automatically backup all photos and videos from my phone. Two years later and I'm using Nextcloud with rsync for $USER space backup. I also use it to backup offline git repos, and everything I compile from source, etc. So yea, whoops.

```duhome="du -h --threshold=20M --exclude /mnt/Storage > storage.txt && vim storage.txt"```

> That's the Bash alias I use to isolate run-away storage issues. For anyone curious.

Like I've said several times before, I have no idea what the traffic is like on this website or these side quest blogs. Imgur use to track views to gifs linked on external pages, but that no longer seems to be the case. I WILL NOT implement Google tracking on this site. If I could get away with it, I'd avoid Javascript altogether for faster page loads. Regardless, thank you for reading, and I hope I've condensed my words down in a way that makes reading this blog pleasant.

> Dude, where's you analytics dude?

Also added a disclaimer on the index page of this site. I barely drink anymore, partly because I prefer CBG/CBD/THC. To be completely honest, one of my deepest fears is vertigo. Beyond the tipsy point really messes with my balance, which in turn dings my self confidence. So yea, I'll continue to talk about substance abuse and use; though I'll do it in a way that makes it all sound most uncool. Just in case some youngsters make their way into this blog. IT'S PAST YOUR BEDTIME (probably)!
