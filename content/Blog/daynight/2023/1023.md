If you spot 'I mean' being used ironically by people that have never attempted to play video games with European types it might have seemed somewhat odd. Shortening words and phrasing to be easily digestible for those with English as a second language might seem tedious and cumbersome, but it can be very beneficial to teams that take on people with a temporarily limited English vocabulary. According to [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=I%20mean), I mean can be pithy, but is usually just an exasperated way of dealing with what life throws at ya. I mean, here I am, writing in this blog right? Anyway, if someone has a problem with 'i mean', maybe suggest the nearest place where they can replace their very fine Oxford shoes. Maybe that's what is making them so irritable.

> Maybe it's all those fish and chips I've been hearing so much about .. lately.

And seriously, if these 'I hate I mean' types give you trouble for how your game character looks, they're just stuck in a mindset that would take a tragedy to break out of. And even that is not a guarantee. "Why me all the time" types might never learn from their own mistakes. Which is sort of heartbreaking, but that's just how it is sometimes.

I will never be a statically minded person, because there's always room for mental growth. Some people see this as a weakness, and that too is somewhat heartbreaking. This is why I tend to say the phrase or idiom: so it goes.
