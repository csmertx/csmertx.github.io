### Donations for the Vets

I don't come from a stable family. Shit was rough for all of us because of a year long tour in the early years of the Vietnam war. It's not like it was all bad. It was just something that not everyone could understand. We adapted to living in low income housing, and we adapted to the chaos that sometimes erupted both at home and around home.

Yea, he was primarily a chef, that's what he was known for. It's called a tour for a reason. All were assigned patrol and watch shifts. So most people on tour saw or did some shit they didn't want to.

> Some real shitty shit.

The donation button for this website redirects to the [Wounded Warrior Project](https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/) donation page, because even though I've been stuck in the same location for several minutes, a lot of people need the push more than I do.

### New Subnet, New Day

For security reasons I won't be posting any screenshots from the new (!) router config. Nextcloud/Snap and Jellyfin/Docker/Snap are all synced up and doing what they do best now. In the future before I sync Nextcloud with my phone I'll be sure to check the box to skip the upload of duplicate photos/videos. The fewer headaches the better.

WiFi 6 is fun right? Disabled that within the first few hours for .. power saving reasons? Static IPs, DoS protection, Firewall, and SSH were all up and running in less than an hour. I had to re-read DoS a few times from the router config before it dawned on me what they meant. I'm so use to seeing [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Types "Wikipedia | Denial-of-service attack #Types") that [DoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "Wikipedia | Denial-of-service attack") may as well be an acronym for spacecraft parts.

> Ah yes, I too have an SSH, and I have a DDoS.

It's 23.10, what more can I say? With no prior information of 23.10 I have no idea what changes were made (other than wallpaper) from 23.04 to 23.10.

> Way to research your subjects breh

What I can say is that I haven't seen an interruption in any of the server-y stuff nor day to day desktop stuff. Pretty much.

Swapped the Steam [.deb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format) "Wikipedia | Deb (file format)") for the [Flatpak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatpak "Wikipedia | Flatpak") using Discover, and Nvidia from 525 to 535 (no GUI for a few minutes) with a [vconsole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console "Wikipedia | Virtual Console"). Thankfully, [nmtui](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/networking_guide/sec-configuring_ip_networking_with_nmtui "Red Hat: Customer Portal | 3.2.Â Configuring IP Networking with nmtui Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7") was already installed.

> Seriously, nmtui should be packaged with everything! EVERYTHING! Fite me irl

At first I reinstalled Kubuntu Desktop and SDDM to be sure there wasn't any corrupted files, then I updated Nvidia from 525 to 535 via ```sudo apt install xserver-xorg-video-nvidia-535```. Thankfully, Kubuntu/Ubuntu/Debian's (?) [Aptitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptitude_(software) "Wikipedia | Aptitude (software)") was kind enough to uninstall 525 before installing 535.
