I am a stranger to hifi equipment required for the 'clarity' offered up from [ðŸ”—Flac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC "Wikipedia | FLAC"). I'd imagine that most albums are cut with $20 headphones in mind, so I'm not sure what point I'm trying to make here. YouTube offers ~128 kbps [ðŸ”—m4a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_file_format "Wikipedia | Audio file format") files that can be converted with some ffmpeg wizardry. That quality seems to be fine for most (~CD quality). I mean, most devices are not equipped with integrated audio capable of anything beyond 192 kbps (lower hifi range iirc).

Might as well make working from home more interesting right?

I'm not sure what headphones most recording studios deploy for audio engineers, but I believe the term 'professional studio headphones' came from those industry standards. So that leaves me with the thought that 'professional studio headphones' will reveal the album as it was revealed to the audio engineers. And that level of audio fidelity is probably more than enough for my untrained and boisterous ears.

Also, I've mentioned my Fossil Hybrid e-ink watch in past blog posts. I respectfully do not recommend. What I've noticed with mine is that the e-ink display refresh leaves artifacts behind from previous frames. A quick 10-15 minute rest in the freezer seems to fix the issue by returning the e-ink display to black. Which is great, but fades back to grey-ish after warming up. I'm not sure if the issue is overheating or a randomly glitchy firmware update. The screen of mine dims in color because most of the artifacts left behind from previous repaints are of the white repaint used to simulate refreshing the screen.

Sleep tracking for [ðŸ”—PineTime](https://www.pine64.org/pinetime/ "PineTime Homepage") in 2024? Oh, and my Fossil Hybrid watch face developed an aged look on the e-ink display due to condensation build-up. Not even suitable in shower steam or any steam. Eat and prepare ramen with your opposite hand or something idk.

PineTime to the rescue! It's a watch that does a few things (music, notifications, timers, stopwatch, etc.). At the moment the stopwatch works for tracking my time while working. I bought two of them, so technically I have a backup once I unbrick the first one I bought a few years ago (whoops--switching from WaspOS to IniniTimeOS did not work out as planned). I wish there was a toggle to disable touch controls. It's water resistant, just not functionally sound in the rain (which is why I bought a Fossil Hybrid--smh). If I could lock out the PineTime screen somehow with a three button press or whatever that would be pretty awesome. Or just to disable to touchscreen. Ghost input will occasionally clear timers and the stopwatch (long arm hairs).

> To be fair, I'm RMA'in my Fossil Hybrid for the sake of sleep tracking. And I'm not worried about Alexa spying on me, because that feature via the watch is so basic it's barely functional

Oh, and the [ðŸ”—inverted colors](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime/issues/1022 "Github | InfiniTimeOrg / InfiniTime / Issues / 1022") anomaly of my PineTime watch appeared after charging.

No comment section via Disqus because I don't have time to babysit this website. I may tap into my middle school self and redesign the website off HTML5 though. Browsed the Defcon website a few times the past few days and realized how kooky this site must look to security professionals. Another Git branch, another dive into HTML. Suppose I could dust off Inkscape and work on the site icons too.
