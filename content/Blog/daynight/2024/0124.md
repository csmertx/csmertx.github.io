### SMD for honoring memories

Finally ordered SMD soldering stuff. Not sure if my late Uncle was into soldering, but the majority of my interest in technology, and circuits came from him. To be fair, the 🔗[KinT](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint "Github | kinx-project / kint") controller I'm putting together is for my work keyboard. Currently using 🔗[Xmodmap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xmodmap "Arch Linux Wiki | Xmodmap") to speed up text editing by using Caps Lock for layer switching. New side hustle requires Windows, so hardware keyboard mapping via 🔗[QMK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QMK "Wikipedia | QMK") just makes more sense.

Probably won't rebase the website off HTML5.

Turns out the Japanese version of the album I wrote of in a previous blog post does not contain the instrumentals. Such is life eh? 

> The South Korean version does tho (also the 2 disc Japanese version)

My story is like a red flag for 'normies', so I stopped caring a long time ago. Which is why there's a fingerboard gif on this page. The best I can hope for is that the work I do speaks for itself, and that people can look past my awkward quirkiness.

> Yea

2023 was an awesome year, and I know 2024 will be even better.

Hope you all enjoy the New Year's funtivities!

### Nothing Left To Fight For

Roughly eleven years ago I felt so lost. No work. So I started a Linux experiment. Let's try 🔗[Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/ "Linux Mint Homepage"), what could go wrong? Within 30 minutes I had a 🔗[LM: 14 Nadio](https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2205 "Linux Mint | Blog | Linux Mint 14 “Nadia” RC released!") 🔗[iso](https://www.howtogeek.com/356714/what-is-an-iso-file-and-how-do-i-open-one/ "How-To Geek | What Is An ISO File (And How Do I Use Them)?") booted, now what? I broke it. Blank screen, no mouse or keyboard input. AWESOME! Up until that moment, I had used some form of Microsoft since 1987. Other than the random virus from 🔗[file sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_file_sharing "Wikipedia | Timeline of file sharing") applications or a botched 🔗[registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry "Wikipedia | Windows Registry") tweak, I had never broken an operating system. I loved that about Linux.

> FREEDOM!!!!!

The freedom this operating system provided was intoxicating. This was before I learned of course that what I was actually referring to was a operating system 🔗[kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system) "Wikipedia | Kernel (operating system)"), and not necessarily the entire operating system. Well, technically the operating system was Linux Mint, so I guess I was technically correct. Which is the best kind of correct.

> Futurama.exe complete

This was during an era of my life before reading manuals. I learned to 🔗[RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM "Wikipedia | RTFM").

> I prefer to be redundant. Obfuscation impedes progress imo

Anyway, I have some strong 🔗[CTC Assam](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-ctc-tea-765674 "The Spruce Eats | All About CTC Tea ") to make before doing a bunch of other stuff. Thought I'd refresh my Linux memories a bit before properly starting the year. First look at 🔗[Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html "Ventoy | Index") kicked my mind gears up a notch as well.

### Long Live PineTime

<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">

![Photo](/Blog/daynight/2024/images/cvs_photolab_casio_gshock_watch_2006.jpg "Myself in 2006 helping a customer fill out a 1-hour photo envelope while wearing a very stylish Casio G-Shock watch")

> I've been a watch person for a while now (MMMM DROP!)

<br />

</div><br />

After several attempts to update the firmware of my 2020 PineTime from 13 to 14 I believe it's time to switch back to my Casio F-91W. It was a fun ride and I wish all the maintainers well (and god(s) speed).

> So many resolved 🔗[Github issues](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed "Github | InfiniTimeOrg / InfiniTime / Issues / Closed") too!

Failed firmware updates has something to do with an Android 14 bug or something like that. From what I understand the 🔗[issue](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime/issues/1954 "Github | InfiniTimeOrg / InfiniTime / issues / 1954") is nearly resolved. Unfortunately, I've nearly broken through the glass at this point. As a teenager I broke the band of at least one G-Shock watch (oh he's hard on watches this one).

> 2001: My hand nearly slipped in between the seat and the table top of a picnic table while I was using the table ... just as it was made to be used of course, and the watch band popped off. I never lie you know ;)

In other news, people can totally live in the center of the Earth. Sure, that's where diamonds were formed (or nearby), so living in the center of the Earth is totally possible. All you have to do is mine the pressure. You know, mine on and whatnot.

> Whatnot. \</storytime> \*shrugs*

### Fine Cinema

<div style="text-align: center;">

> ONLY THE BEST!

<br />

</div><br />

Some of my first campy memories are of watching 🔗[Tales from the Crypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_from_the_Crypt_(TV_series) "Wikipedia | Tales from the Crypt (TV series)") from a Jacksonville, FL hotel (1989). Dad fell asleep, and I couldn't pull my eyes from the screen. Flying from Bermuda to Florida type jet lag. Probably avoided the 🔗[Triangle](https://www.britannica.com/facts/Bermuda-Triangle "Britannica | Bermuda Triangle Facts"), but still--that's a long dual flight trip (Bermuda > South Carolina > North Florida).

> I'm partial to the 🔗[methane theory](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2016/mar/14/giant-gas-bubbles-mystery-bermuda-triangle "The Guardian | Oceans | Do giant gas bubbles explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle?") tbh

It's definitely inherited, whatever it is that compels me to watch 🔗[MST3K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000 "Wikipedia | Mystery Science Theater 3000") and movies that should be featured in future episodes (Toho Godzilla 🤞)

> In the meantime I have a 🔗[1995 Turkey Day Marathon](https://github.com/csmertx/dotfiles/blob/master/turkey_day_mst3k_1995.sh "Github | csmertx / dotfiles / blob / main / turkey_day_mst3k_1995.sh") to watch (complete with commercials!)

In other 'news', I finished the 🔗[KinT](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint "Github | kinx-project / kint") controller after two years of dragging my feet. Actually, it's been so long that there's a new Kinesis Advantage 🔗[keyboard](https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage360/ "Kinesis | Advantage360"). Not my style tbh

<br />

> Super professional setup and the hotplate was plugged into a GFCI outlet (that I installed years ago) just in case

<br />

> Not sure if I cooked the components, but the board works.. so.. success? (neoprene pad on the keyboard hides the LEDs anyway)

<br />

I'll have a hotplate with temperature sensor for when I put together the backup controller. And since the Teensy 3.6 is 🔗[no longer manufactured](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/DEV-14058/6569369 "DigiKey | Products | Sparkfun Electronics | DEV-14058 (Teensy 3.6 w/Headers)") I placed a 4.1 in the same DigiKey 🔗[BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials "Wikipedia | Bill of materials") I used for the first KinT controller. It took a few minutes for the solder to liquify using the LED strip hot plate (I also had to remove two of the screws)--slight anxst tbh

> ANXST.

Once the second build is finished I'll add it to the device/keyboard category of this website.

> COMING SOON! 2030!
