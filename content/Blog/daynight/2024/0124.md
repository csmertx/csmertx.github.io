Finally ordered SMD soldering stuff. Not sure if my late Uncle was into soldering, but the majority of my interest in technology, and circuits came from him. To be fair, the ðŸ”—[KinT](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint "Github | kinx-project / kint") controller I'm putting together is for my work keyboard. Currently using ðŸ”—[Xmodmap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xmodmap "Arch Linux Wiki | Xmodmap") to speed up text editing by using Caps Lock for layer switching. New side hustle requires Windows, so hardware keyboard mapping via ðŸ”—[QMK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QMK "Wikipedia | QMK") just makes more sense.

My story is like a red flag for 'normies', so I stopped caring a long time ago. Which is why there's a fingerboard gif on this page. The best I can hope for is that the work I do speaks for itself, and that people can look past my awkward quirkiness.

2023 was an awesome year, and I know 2024 will be even better.

Hope you all enjoy the New Year's funtivities!
