### Fitbit Sense 2 (Google)

> Pretty great

<br />

</div><br />

After a week of wearing my Sense 2 the ðŸ”—[Smart Wake](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/technology/sleep "Fitbit | Technology | Sleep") feature became a _VERY_ compelling feature.

> First off, I should start off by implicitly stating that I do not care where the data is sent. It's a Google device meant to be paired with Android, which are two notoriously implicit companies in the mind of the public regarding the distribution of private data.

Ok, disclaimer out of the way. Great. The photo above shows that KDE Connect can be configured to relay notifications from Linux computers.

> One day I'll rewrite the script in Python and talk to DBUS instead of using a helper app like ðŸ”—[notify-send](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/notify-send.1.html "Ubuntu.com | Manpages | Xenial | notify-send"), but that day is not today.

If you've read this far I should point out that this is more of a first impression, from the stand point of someone that has some smartwatch experience, though most of my watch experience hails from G-Shock and Timex Expedition watches.

Summary: <b>It's good, not great</b>

I appreciate the financial accessibility by means of cost cutting measures, like possibly striking a deal with Amazon (Alexa) to subsidize the price of the internal speaker. Unfortunately, this means that you'll only hear Alexa's voice.

> She does say good morning or good afternoon in a way that matches my Da Bears talking cadence. So that's not weird.

No music support. I'm not sure if Alexa can display lyrics to songs on other devices, but on this sense 2, user input regarding lyrics is a dead end.

> I tried to trick Alexa into setting an audible alarm and that didn't work either

According to the review videos I watched before purchase (ðŸ”—[CNET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oer27MXESQ "YouTube | CNET - Fitbit Sense 2 Hands-On: New Stress Tracking and Better Software"), ðŸ”—[The Quantified Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ4wGFMb0Aw "YouTube | The Quantified Scientist")), the check-in notifications aren't as helpful for some.

This is where I diverge from the crowd. I activated all the health data notifications on the watch, and that cascaded to an interesting side effect. I became more aware of my watch--as if the notifications have drilled into my subconscious which triggered in me an acute hyper awareness of the watch while I slept.

> We have bonded. It is done.

At the moment it takes a week or two for the Smart Wake feature to get a sense (!) of what phase of sleep you're brain is in at any given moment--it's decent as an alarm clock. Even for heavy sleepers (idk about ðŸ”—[Screamin Meanie](https://screamingmeanie.com/ "Screaming Meanie.com") users tho).

I set my alarms in line with the red lines in the chart above, and that seems to have helped. The Smart Wake alarm feature seems to accurately monitor my sleep rhythm to really dial in the right time to pull me out of the dream world. With that said, I have never before used an AI assisted wake feature via smartwatch. YMMV

### 3D Printing

I had a lot of fun showcasing 3D printing projects I found on Thingiverse back in 2016-2017 via Twitter.

> Less fun playing with automated tweet lists and attempted t-shirts sales tho (sry)

There's no animosity in me towards the 3D printing community. It takes a lot for me not to like someone. I think that we all have our own super hero like quirks, and most people are decent and unique.

> I FEAR A 3D PRINTED PLANET! (tongue and cheek)

My family made a big deal out of DIY growing up. Everything was a DIY project. Make shelves. Make butcher block table. Replace various sized belts. Make tree house platform. Troubleshoot why thing leaks. Troubleshoot why car won't start. Transplant R/C car parts into a custom boat shell and watch while it takes on water. Follow instructions. Turn picnic table into ping pong table. 3D printing seemed like an extension of traditional DIY, so I was compelled to be a part of it, even for just a little bit.

> FDM prints in Nylon ... sheeesh

Like I said before, when I worked at CVS (even as a shift supervisor) I hid from the public. I'd organize the stockroom instead of whatever it was that was happening in the store. I'd choose to move gallon water displays and 12pk soda displays instead of register duty.

> 6pk gallon water displays for hurricane season? Yes, please.

I KNOW I am not alone when I say that I still enjoy amazing YouTube videos from the 3D printing community. Please keep it going. You've got this, and you know it.

### The Four Horsemen

I've had a healthy fear of horses, cows, and other large four legged animals for as long as I can remember. Ironic that I ended up working at a horse racing track in my early twenties. Also ironic considering the main magnet program for my first middle school (grades 6-12) was agriculture.

> More afraid of horses than I am of sharks tbh

Long time ago I was known as Sharky because of my teeth, and probably because I never stopped skating. Wherever, whenever, my fingers clutched the nose of my board even when my hand ached. Always ready to throw down and skate. I only held the board by the trucks when provoked (wasn't often). This was the same timeline in which Dad would use his non-callused hands to check my mine for calluses. It was when I watched a cut partially close during a visit to a local beach when I recognized why my calluses seem to just fall off. Superficial stuff. Besides, why not gloves?

> When I broke a skateboard bearing for the first time I wore it as a ring lol

It's not like I'm afraid of all animals. It's also not like I'm out there feeding squirrels or communing with nature--they can bite through sk.., well, they supplement their diets with protein, and they don't leave much behind. I was in the wilderness long enough to see the carnage and understand that as a species we came out of that mess. It's difficult to separate one self from the encoding that echoes back through the ages. That's the essence that separates Us from the beasts. We can see ourselves from the eyes of others, and not just from our own perspective. Which is crucial for inner growth.

> Seriously, squirrels are not to be truffled with

As a side note, the trick to fishing efficiently on an ultra budget is to use grasshoppers. Find a butterfly net or a large fish tank net and a field that hasn't been groomed at just the right time. Dew point is important. Grasshoppers crawl to the top of grass to lick the dew before they eat. Even the larger ðŸ”—[eastern lubber grasshopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romalea "Wikipedia | Romalea (lubber)") makes for great top water action. Theoretically, the larger the grasshopper, the larger the fish. One thing to keep in mind is that although grasshoppers are great for top water fish, they're also a crunchy snack for turtles. Highest risk of ðŸ”—[Salmonella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella "Wikipedia | Salmonella"), and a real pain in the ass to unhook. Anyway, hold the net so the middle of it is inline with the tops of the grass, and run. Load the haul into a critter keeper, and keep collecting until you have enough. Make sure to collect a few more than you need--I mean, they're grasshoppers. IIRC, there's a place to thread the hook through the backs of grasshoppers (through the carapace).

> "Bro, do you even collect grasshoppers and mount them?" \*Rides Grasshopper into Sunset\*

One of my fishing experiments from my elementary school days. I guess my desire to eat fish outweighed my desire to protect ðŸ”—[Jiminy Cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiminy_Cricket "Wikipedia | Jiminy Cricket"). Also less messy than slimy earthworms. Dude, Indiana soil is no joke. My eyes must have lit up when Grandfather said their were nightcrawlers in the soil. Hard packed clay soil. Felt like I was chipping away wood or something. Juicy worms tho.

> And that's how I learned the ways and how to avoid ðŸ”—[Machin shin](https://wot.fandom.com/wiki/Ways#Machin_Shin "Fandom | The Wheel of Time | Machin Shin").

Technically, it would be far more efficient to indulge in ðŸ”—[Capulines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapulines) than to use them to catch fish. If I had known people were toasting grasshoppers when I was gathering them for fishing, I probably would had tried cooking Capulines.

> Chorizo and Capulines? Next level flavor country. 

About vampires. Thankfully, there are people that dedicate their lives to deal with vampires. They're very good at what they do, and their hyper-focused minds use fast math to save lives. They keep their minds sharp, and their observations sharper. Their movements are coupled with an air of indifference and emotional detachment. It's a pity that these vampires are always caught off guard--vampire hunters are rarely a concern for the those that lack hubris. Honeyed words mean nothing to these hunters. They're trained to detect the slightest of shaky hand movements, and breathing cadence with an unwavering gaze. And they all have the patience of a saint. They also earn their own money, so why would they want yours?

> Novelist you say? Well now, I should probably pick out a typewriter. Hermes 3000? Royal? Olivetti? Or what about a Smith & Corona? So many choices.. lol

That Hermes 3000 fr tho..

> Currently remembering the faces of kindergarten. Dude, we had an indoors table top sandbox. Little dump trucks and stuff. Little shovels. It was awesome.
