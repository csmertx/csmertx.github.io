> Pretty great

<br />

</div><br />

After a week of wearing my Sense 2 the ðŸ”—[Smart Wake](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/technology/sleep "Fitbit | Technology | Sleep") feature became a _VERY_ compelling feature.

> First off, I should start off by implicitly stating that I do not care where the data is sent. It's a Google device meant to be paired with Android, which are two notoriously implicit companies in the mind of the public regarding the distribution of private data.

Ok, disclaimer out of the way. Great. The photo above shows that KDE Connect can be configured to relay notifications from Linux computers.

> One day I'll rewrite the script in Python and talk to DBUS instead of using a helper app like ðŸ”—[notify-send](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/notify-send.1.html "Ubuntu.com | Manpages | Xenial | notify-send"), but that day is not today.

If you've read this far I should point out that this is more of a first impression, from the stand point of someone that has some smartwatch experience, though most of my watch experience hails from G-Shock and Timex Expedition watches.

Summary: <b>It's good, not great</b>

I appreciate the financial accessibility by means of cost cutting measures, like possibly striking a deal with Amazon (Alexa) to subsidize the price of the internal speaker. Unfortunately, this means that you'll only hear Alexa's voice.

> She does say good morning or good afternoon in a way that matches my Da Bears talking cadence. So that's not weird.

No music support. I'm not sure if Alexa can display lyrics to songs on other devices, but on this sense 2, user input regarding lyrics is a dead end.

> I tried to trick Alexa into setting an audible alarm and that didn't work either

According to the review videos I watched before purchase (ðŸ”—[CNET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oer27MXESQ "YouTube | CNET - Fitbit Sense 2 Hands-On: New Stress Tracking and Better Software"), ðŸ”—[The Quantified Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ4wGFMb0Aw "YouTube | The Quantified Scientist")), the check-in notifications aren't as helpful for some.

This is where I diverge from the crowd. I activated all the health data notifications on the watch, and that cascaded to an interesting side effect. I became more aware of my watch--as if the notifications have drilled into my subconscious which triggered in me an acute hyper awareness of the watch while I slept.

> We have bonded. It is done.

At the moment it takes a week or two for the Smart Wake feature to get a sense (!) of what phase of sleep you're brain is in at any given moment--it's decent as an alarm clock. Even for heavy sleepers (idk about ðŸ”—[Screamin Meanie](https://screamingmeanie.com/ "Screaming Meanie.com") users tho).

I set my alarms in line with the red lines in the chart above, and that seems to have helped. The Smart Wake alarm feature seems to accurately monitor my sleep rhythm to really dial in the right time to pull me out of the dream world. With that said, I have never before used an AI assisted wake feature via smartwatch. YMMV

### 3D Printing

I had a lot of fun showcasing 3D printing projects I found on Thingiverse back in 2016-2017 via Twitter.

> Less fun playing with automated tweet lists and attempted t-shirts sales tho (sry)

There's no animosity in me towards the 3D printing community. It takes a lot for me not to like someone. I think that we all have our own super hero like quirks, and most people are decent and unique.

> I FEAR A 3D PRINTED PLANET! (tongue and cheek)

My family made a big deal out of DIY growing up. Everything was a DIY project. Make shelves. Make butcher block table. Replace various sized belts. Make tree house platform. Troubleshoot why thing leaks. Troubleshoot why car won't start. Transplant R/C car parts into a custom boat shell and watch while it takes on water. Follow instructions. Turn picnic table into ping pong table. 3D printing seemed like an extension of traditional DIY, so I was compelled to be a part of it, even for just a little bit.

> Just cuz

</div><br />

Like I said before, when I worked at CVS (even as a shift supervisor) I hid from the public. I'd organize the stockroom instead of whatever it was that was happening in the store. I'd choose to move gallon water displays and 12pk soda displays instead of register duty.

> 6pk gallon water displays for hurricane season? Yes, please.

I KNOW I am not alone when I say that I still enjoy amazing YouTube videos from the 3D printing community. Please keep it going. You've got this, and you know it.
