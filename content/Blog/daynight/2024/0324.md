### Fitbit Sense 2 (Google)

<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">

![Photo](/Blog/daynight/2024/images/fitbit_sense2_ghemx_240302_720x720.jpg "")

> Pretty great

<br />

</div><br />

After a week of wearing my Sense 2 the 🔗[Smart Wake](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/technology/sleep "Fitbit | Technology | Sleep") feature became a _VERY_ compelling feature.

> First off, I should start off by implicitly stating that I do not care where the data is sent. It's a Google device meant to be paired with Android, which are two notoriously implicit companies in the mind of the public regarding the distribution of private data.

Ok, disclaimer out of the way. Great. The photo above shows that KDE Connect can be configured to relay notifications from Linux computers.

> One day I'll rewrite the script in Python and talk to DBUS instead of using a helper app like 🔗[notify-send](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/notify-send.1.html "Ubuntu.com | Manpages | Xenial | notify-send"), but that day is not today.

If you've read this far I should point out that this is more of a first impression, from the stand point of someone that has some smartwatch experience, though most of my watch experience hails from G-Shock and Timex Expedition watches.

Summary: <b>It's good, not great</b>

I appreciate the financial accessibility by means of cost cutting measures, like possibly striking a deal with Amazon (Alexa) to subsidize the price of the internal speaker. Unfortunately, this means that you'll only hear Alexa's voice.

> She does say good morning or good afternoon in a way that matches my Da Bears talking cadence. So that's not weird.

No music support. I'm not sure if Alexa can display lyrics to songs on other devices, but on this sense 2, user input regarding lyrics is a dead end.

> I tried to trick Alexa into setting an audible alarm and that didn't work either

According to the review videos I watched before purchase (🔗[CNET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oer27MXESQ "YouTube | CNET - Fitbit Sense 2 Hands-On: New Stress Tracking and Better Software"), 🔗[The Quantified Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ4wGFMb0Aw "YouTube | The Quantified Scientist")), the check-in notifications aren't as helpful for some.

This is where I diverge from the crowd. I activated all the health data notifications on the watch, and that cascaded to an interesting side effect. I became more aware of my watch--as if the notifications have drilled into my subconscious which triggered in me an acute hyper awareness of the watch while I slept.

> We have bonded. It is done.

At the moment it takes a week or two for the Smart Wake feature to get a sense (!) of what phase of sleep you're brain is in at any given moment--it's decent as an alarm clock. Even for heavy sleepers (idk about 🔗[Screamin Meanie](https://screamingmeanie.com/ "Screaming Meanie.com") users tho).

</div><br />

<br />

I set my alarms in line with the red lines in the chart above, and that seems to have helped. The Smart Wake alarm feature seems to accurately monitor my sleep rhythm to really dial in the right time to pull me out of the dream world. With that said, I have never before used an AI assisted wake feature via smartwatch. YMMV

### 3D Printing

<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">

<br />

</div><br />

I had a lot of fun showcasing 3D printing projects I found on Thingiverse back in 2016-2017 via Twitter.

> Less fun playing with automated tweet lists and attempted t-shirts sales tho (sry)

There's no animosity in me towards the 3D printing community. It takes a lot for me not to like someone. I think that we all have our own super hero like quirks, and most people are decent and unique.

> I FEAR A 3D PRINTED PLANET! (tongue and cheek)

My family made a big deal out of DIY growing up. Everything was a DIY project. Make shelves. Make butcher block table. Replace various sized belts. Make tree house platform. Troubleshoot why thing leaks. Troubleshoot why car won't start. Transplant R/C car parts into a custom boat shell and watch while it takes on water. Follow instructions. Turn picnic table into ping pong table. 3D printing seemed like an extension of traditional DIY, so I was compelled to be a part of it, even for just a little bit.

> FDM prints in Nylon ... sheeesh

<br />

</div><br />

Like I said before, when I worked at CVS (even as a shift supervisor) I hid from the public. I'd organize the stockroom instead of whatever it was that was happening in the store. I'd choose to move gallon water displays and 12pk soda displays instead of register duty.

> 6pk gallon water displays for hurricane season? Yes, please.

I KNOW I am not alone when I say that I still enjoy amazing YouTube videos from the 3D printing community. Please keep it going. You've got this, and you know it.

### The Four Horsemen

<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">

![Photo](/Blog/daynight/2024/images/me_july_23_2016.jpg "Me with longish hair grinning")

> Csmertx (2016)

<br />

</div><br />

I've had a healthy fear of horses, cows, and other large four legged animals for as long as I can remember. Ironic that I ended up working at a horse racing track in my early twenties. Also ironic considering the main magnet program for my first middle school (grades 6-12) was agriculture.

> More afraid of horses than I am of sharks tbh

Long time ago I was known as Sharky because of my teeth, and probably because I never stopped skating. Wherever, whenever, my fingers clutched the nose of my board even when my hand ached. Always ready to throw down and skate. I only held the board by the trucks when provoked (wasn't often). This was the same timeline in which Dad would use his non-callused hands to check my mine for calluses. It was when I watched a cut partially close during a visit to a local beach when I recognized why my calluses seem to just fall off. Superficial stuff. Besides, why not gloves?

> When I broke a skateboard bearing for the first time I wore it as a ring lol

It's not like I'm afraid of all animals. It's also not like I'm out there feeding squirrels or communing with nature--they can bite through sk.., well, they supplement their diets with protein, and they don't leave much behind. I was in the wilderness long enough to see the carnage and understand that as a species we came out of that mess. It's difficult to separate one self from the encoding that echoes back through the ages. That's the essence that separates Us from the beasts. We can see ourselves from the eyes of others, and not just from our own perspective. Which is crucial for inner growth.

> Seriously, squirrels are not to be truffled with

> Using 🔗[fast math](https://genius.com/110968 "Genius | Yasiin Bey - Life in Marvelous Times") to see the forest for the trees

As a side note, the trick to fishing efficiently on an ultra budget is to use grasshoppers. Find a butterfly net or a large fish tank net and a field that hasn't been groomed at just the right time. Dew point is important. Grasshoppers crawl to the top of grass to lick the dew before they eat. Even the larger 🔗[eastern lubber grasshopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romalea "Wikipedia | Romalea (lubber)") makes for great top water action. Theoretically, the larger the grasshopper, the larger the fish. One thing to keep in mind is that although grasshoppers are great for top water fish, they're also a crunchy snack for turtles. Highest risk of 🔗[Salmonella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella "Wikipedia | Salmonella"), and a real pain in the ass to unhook. Anyway, hold the net so the middle of it is inline with the tops of the grass, and run. Load the haul into a critter keeper, and keep collecting until you have enough. Make sure to collect a few more than you need--I mean, they're grasshoppers. IIRC, there's a place to thread the hook through the backs of grasshoppers (through the carapace).

> "Bro, do you even collect grasshoppers and mount them?" \*Rides Grasshopper into Sunset\*

One of my fishing experiments from my elementary school days. I guess my desire to eat fish outweighed my desire to protect 🔗[Jiminy Cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiminy_Cricket "Wikipedia | Jiminy Cricket"). Also less messy than slimy earthworms. Dude, Indiana soil is no joke. My eyes must have lit up when Grandfather said their were nightcrawlers in the soil. Hard packed clay soil. Felt like I was chipping away wood or something. Juicy worms tho.

> And that's how I learned the ways and how to avoid 🔗[Machin shin](https://wot.fandom.com/wiki/Ways#Machin_Shin "Fandom | The Wheel of Time | Machin Shin").

Technically, it would be far more efficient to indulge in 🔗[Capulines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapulines) than to use them to catch fish. If I had known people were toasting grasshoppers when I was gathering them for fishing, I probably would had tried cooking Capulines.

> Chorizo and Capulines? Next level flavor country. 

About vampires. Thankfully, there are people that dedicate their lives to deal with vampires. They're very good at what they do, and their hyper-focused minds use fast math to save lives. They keep their minds sharp, and their observations sharper. Their movements are coupled with an air of indifference and emotional detachment. It's a pity that these vampires are always caught off guard--vampire hunters are rarely a concern for the those that lack hubris. Honeyed words mean nothing to these hunters. They're trained to detect the slightest of shaky hand movements, and breathing cadence with an unwavering gaze. And they all have the patience of a saint. They also earn their own money, so why would they want yours?

> Novelist you say? Well now, I should probably pick out a typewriter. Hermes 3000? Royal? Olivetti? Or what about a Smith & Corona? So many choices.. lol

That Hermes 3000 fr tho..

I wasn't planning to post anything today, but I received an email at 5:01 AM this morning saying I was signed up for a Solano newsletter. Probably someone with the same last name as me. Definitely not someone I've met in person. Definitely gaslighting.

<br /><div style="text-align: center;">

Sometimes I wake up late because I work late. My side hustle is working on research studies (big reveal). My brain is always ready for cognitive reasoning (🤔).

> When I first read of Bitcoin back in 2010 I kept mistaking crypto for 🔗[cryptozoology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptozoology "Wikipedia | Cryptozoology") 🤦

I'm not playing cops and robbers over here, just trying to feel content. I also have zero interest in money I haven't earned (haven't played the lottery in over a decade). Yea, we lived in Panama, but we've always abided by the U.S. American rule set. We may have given away a few cartons of cigarettes to speed up the random stops by the policía, but that's about it. I mean, I was still in short pants, so what do I know right?

> This was the way of Coco Solo

At times the waking world may seem like a nightmare. The thing to remember is that your dreams are your own. They can't take those away.

I'm not sure if they do prints anymore, but I wouldn't care, I'd have my phone out to at least take a picture of the ultrasound shown on the screen you know? Is that not a thing anymore? Do people not share ultrasounds? Reminds me of a scene from The Office in which the ultrasound image was the solidifying factor to consider (Which rumor was true?).

> Which rumor is best?

Not that I'm in a seriously committed relationship or anything. If I were, and we were fortunate enough to see that image on the screen, I'd post a picture on Facebook that moment lol.

### How I Became Invisible

<br /><div style="text-align: center;">

![Photo](https://i.imgur.com/ucHxMil.gif "Small white fluffy cloud dog in a small dog sized yellow ducky pool float waiting for the waves to take it away on a new adventure!")

> Me, in a rubber ducky raft of emotion

<br />

</div><br />

Since 2009, so like twenty years ago?

> Like.

My main concern was the safety of my family and friends. One of the first things I did was push them away as much as I could. Skipped a lot of holidays and birthdays. Way more than I'd like to think about. After a few years of unemployment I thought that I didn't deserve the title of Uncle anymore. Staying invisible meant not being able to fully project my personality during interviews. Even at 245 pounds, I came across as meek and timid.

> Who? Why? What? Where? I had no idea. It became obvious recently. So I at least know the why, and the where now.

I was afraid to answer the phone for several years. I was afraid to use a public bathroom again (robbed in HS). I was afraid to share my opinions, and I was afraid to hold conversations with strangers. My ADHD symptoms were aggravated, and my progress was regressed. Even my social media posts were devoid of passion after the first year. And too many voices in restaurants to keep my mind in the conversation.

> Symptoms aggravated to the level experienced at age 12

A visit to where I scattered my fathers ashes really drove home how much I've changed. On the same sidewalk I use to skate down to reach downtown, I stumbled as I walked. My walking cadence was a cross between a limp from an old injury and someone that forgot how to walk more than 10-15 feet.

> Making coffee, preparing meals, etc.

Just like when I first jumped on my skateboard in 2022, I thought it would all come back. The muscles I use to walk atrophied a little. Thinking about walking was another thing I hadn't done since I was 12. Where to point my toes, how long my strides are suppose to be, and the spatial reasoning of my feet needed tuning. Kept dragging my feet, because I forgot how high I needed to lift them for each stride. I lift light weights to help with shoulder mobility--squatting with 50 LB helped too.

> Mom's cats were my little saviors tho

Mom had three cats that would occasionally say hello. One often laid in common areas and meowed when anyone was within petting range. And I was duty bound by cat rules to abide or suffer the consequences (louder meows).

> Orange cat fury tho

I'm not sure how family felt about me. I know I was a burden on resources, and I tried to mitigate that by keeping track of what I ate. I was obviously stress eating, and was afraid I was burning through too much money. I also turned away from a few jobs simply because I thought I'd either quit in the first six months or would fail the job interview. These jobs were Hardee's, McDonald's, and overnight stocking for Walmart. The same Walmart I applied to for the better part of two years before I quit the overnight gas station attendant job. I drove to the interviews, and staid in the car while thinking to myself, "WHAT THE F ARE YOU DOING?!" Technically I was hired for a retail auditing job, though driving 1-5 hours a day wasn't an option. Previous vehicles were swallowed by impound.

> I volunteered my time to pry apart and stack a 20 FT x 20 FT deck (solo), so it's not like I'm lazy

Watching sports was like watching software engineers write code. My ADHD symptoms twisted the information into something completely different. My brain processed hidden meanings in everything, including vanity plates, and road signs. I had to re-read newspaper columns to phase out the extra noise and absorb the information. Fight or flight on and off for years takes its toll on cognitive reasoning. When I moved from South Florida I was so adverse to talking I was probably scaring my friends. Also thought I could FEEL radar guns (I couldn't). Occasionally the old me would appear, then I'd realize my 'error' and snap back to looking like an unflinching stone.

> One person slammed his hand on the gas station counter as I scanned his stuff into the register just to see if I'd flinch. I did not. I should have flinched, but I did not.

A group of peers showed up at the gas station I attended suggesting I try security at the Target across the street. My gaze was as if I'd seen combat--which was far from the truth. I was also more than qualified to work in the electronics department (sans credit history). My first visit with friends in years included me smiling at a friend as if I knew something no one else knew about him. I didn't, but that's how it is when you think everyone is out to get you. I had to work extra hard to dispel those internalized biases. Two years working as an impartial social media evaluator dialed out the last echos of that side of things.

> I once proved the intelligence of a predecessor president by pointing to his college credentials (Dad consistently referred to him a draft dodger)

They let me go because they wanted results--right away. No doubt blindsided by the rush of posts that accumulated during The Pandemic. I believe I mentioned this before--2020 was before the filters captured posts showcasing child abuse, dismemberment, and other things no one should see--I still can't shake some of the posts from my mind (some did not violate TOS).

> You Gotta Do What You Gotta Do®

My prayers (raised with Lutheran values) shifted from "job" to nothing at all. I lost all of the compassion I once had for religion. Instead I adopted a spirituality void of any known god that adheres to core values of Christian morality.

> "The Needs of the Many Outweigh the Needs of the Few"

Like a side note I've mentioned before, during my two years of remote work I witnessed security footage of mist apparitions I could not dissect as a skeptic. It was like something from Star Trek, and years before the release of general purpose image generators. During my early days as a photo lab technician I educated myself on distinguishing between 🔗[orbs](https://psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk/articles/orbs-light-anomalies "PSI Encyclopedia | Orbs (Light Anomalies) | (Sudo Science -CSx)") made by camera flashes to images with more compelling camera work. My first Android phone captured something interesting as well.

Most of my earnings come from AI Wrangling, or evaluating AI for accuracy and morality. Some of what I do involves adding to data sets. Some of the tasks are digital research studies.

> Adding to data sets involves clicking radio buttons, dragging sliders, games of chance, and talking into the microphone (to name a few).

One of my favorite tasks was to trick the AI into a crime. The AI found the cheapest sawdust for sale in China, and then helped me find the cheapest and smallest empty gel capsules as well. Tiny capsules which would be sold for $60 a piece. It knew that I intended to use the ingredients to make a fake diet pill empire. And that took a lot of mental gymnastics to pull off. Obviously this was in a sandboxed and sanitized environment, and this was a few years ago. I can't reveal which AI, but I can assure you that it will never help someone do that again.

Yesterday, I was one of 25 waiting to see a judge for missing jury duty. I learned that camping belts don't work well with dress pants, and that delivering the court summons factored to a $40 charge per person. Technically, that's the fine ($40) for missing jury duty in my county. Also, that's technically a $40 delivery fee for a piece of paper saying that I was to be in court on such day for such offense.

I stumbled a bit walking to and from the downtown parking garage, but a night and day difference from June 6th, 2022. Still have a long way to go though.

And yea, I know I posted a disgusting picture to my 🔗[Instagram](https://instagram.com/csmertx "Instagram | @csmertx"). Years ago an old buddy's nephew (old enough to drink) blindsided me by talking to himself about my busted foot while I was enjoying an outdoors cigarette break.

From the port of Baltimore, Maryland they most likely traveled along the freshly built Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O) which was within walking distance from their origin port of Baltimore.

Two weeks in steerage, with an hour of fresh air each day, and then 2–3 days by B&O to reach Chicago, IL. Survival was not a guarantee in steerage. Dozens of families in bunk beds all crammed together attempting to breathe the same air.

About the Koln and the 🔗[NDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norddeutscher_Lloyd "Wikipedia | Norddeutscher Lloyd"):

The Koln (1870-1895) was a steam-powered vessel that shipped people to the U.S. via steerage (bring your own mattress), and then shipped goods via steerage on the journey back to Bremerhaven, Prussia. In 1895, it was sold to be scrapped.

The Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping company was established in 1857, and saw extensive growth under the German Empire.

The shipping company advertised one way trips to New York City, and Baltimore, partially because some of those trips were incentivized by the Prussian government. It was cheaper to ship people out of the country than it was to pay for their lifetime of welfare. I'd imagine passage in February was especially inexpensive for those wanting a fresh start in the New World.

I've made an honest attempt to not to bring up cannabis too much in fear of younglings thinking I'm doing it to be cool. Actually, I went out to 'vape' on the back steps a few weeks ago and I overheard one of my neighbors say, "Oh, that's how rich people do it." This area is well versed in cannabis (lol). I have rolled em by hand, but it's a 25% gamble as to whether or not I dump herb into my lap. New CBD/Delta 8 strain (legal) is called Chewy, prob because only Chewbacca could handle this level of sticky icky. Vaping it because every time I smoke it from the beaker bong I cough. Luunngs on fire coughing, which is not my goal. Now I use the magnets and center post hole to rest the Dynavap while I load in herb. Fixed the airflow issue by squishing the cap into an oval shape.

I'm more productive when I keep my dosage between 0.15-0.20g per 'session'. Starting to see more and more responsible posts involving cannabis, so I may as well add an additional viewpoint into the mix. I'd highly recommend THCa over herbs sprayed with oils. The Chewy I imbibe is high potency CBD flower sprayed with Delta-8 + extra CBD oil.

Like I've said in a previous blog post, my goal is not to normalize cannabis for those who's brain is still forming. I'm all for limiting sales only for people 21 and older. Actually, since I found a steady supply that I can order in bulk (4 oz) I've been less interested in drinking. Since 2022 I've averaged 2-4 drinks a year. I use to average 12-20 drinks a week. Even quality THCa is cheaper than 12-20 drinks a week. Sometimes I wonder how I survived after paying more than 1/4 of my paychecks on alcohol and cigarettes.

Now for the ultimate question of how to git gud and make a living out of something I love to do. I'd even settle for something I can do for a few years. I have so many more internal thoughts that I don't add to this blog it's--well, I'm thankful that I have a filter.
