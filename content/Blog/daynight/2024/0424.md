> I present to you Tigger: One of the coolest cats ever (RIP)

<br />

</div><br />

Three months tied to my Fitbit (Google) Sense 2, and here's my well sought after opinion (my pro-am, semi-pro, part-time reviewer opinions are my own).

> He's tough on watches this one

- Battery life longer than two days

- Easy to read screen that blanks surprisingly quickly

- Watch face ecosystem mostly co-opted by third parties

- Microphone for txt responses (idk, did not use it) or Alexa

- Remappable long button press (Alexa, weather, health statistics, etc.)

- Easy to clean & why are the emoji smiley's all wearing headbands? Dude..

I turned on all metrics, including the 🔗[ECG monitor](https://www.fitbit.com/global/fi/technology/ecg "Fitbit | ECG"), and the mood thing. Neither have been especially helpful for my day to day other than the mood feature having a secondary effect of helping me to wake up. There's probably a very apt psychological term for the phenomenon. I'll call it, uh, the watch is now controlling my subconcious thoughts phenomenon.

> Help.

We'll see whether or not Google nerfs it with a firmware update. If early planned obsolence then idk, switch to iOS? Ultra? Ultra.

> To be fair, Tigger's meows were always polite
