Three months tied to my Fitbit (Google) Sense 2, and here's my well sought after opinion (my pro-am, semi-pro, part-time reviewer opinions are my own).

> He's tough on watches this one

- Battery life longer than two days

- Easy to read screen that blanks surprisingly quickly

- Watch face ecosystem mostly co-opted by third parties

- Microphone for txt responses (idk, did not use it) or Alexa

- Remappable long button press (Alexa, weather, health statistics, etc.)

- Consistently poor sync with weather icon on watch face (°_ _ _°)

- Easy to clean & seems to handle rain well

- Emoji smileys all wearing headbands? Sports? Because sports?

I turned on all metrics, including the 🔗[ECG monitor](https://www.fitbit.com/global/fi/technology/ecg "Fitbit | ECG"), and the mood thing. Neither have been especially helpful for my day to day other than the mood feature having a secondary effect of helping me to wake up. There's probably a very apt psychological term for the phenomenon. I'll call it, uh, the watch is now controlling my subconcious thoughts phenomenon.

> Help.

We'll see whether or not Google nerfs it with a firmware update. If early planned obsolence then idk, switch to iOS? Ultra? Ultra.

> To be fair, Tigger's meows were always polite

Yea, from all the posts I've read of people directing the Linux curious to Linux Mint, I thought it would be fine. What I kept running into is this strange disconnect between Linux Mint and Ubuntu incompatibilities. I'd imagine there may be a person reading this in the future saying to themselves, "Well duh, did you not read X?" No @person_of_the_futures_totally_real_profile_picture_prob_not_a_bot, but I wish I had read it.

> Tux on the desk is unaffected by this information.

I use an older Thinkcentre M73 (upgraded to an M93) as my main desktop computer. It sips on power, doesn't take a server grade UPS to keep it running, and allows me to get some work done. Since my desktop is part of the Lenovo's Think line of products (formerly IBM's line of products) I think it's reasonable to assume a good amount of compatibility with Linux operating systems. I'm not sure if the issue I faced is a compatibility issue. Audio and video occasionally hiccuped. It wasn't something I could predict, so I can reasonably believe the hiccups were not trigged by an app or script. It seemed more like the CPU scheduler prioritized networking and storage over audio and video. Of course we all know that my previous statement is riddled with speculation that would never hold to scrutiny in a court of law.

> An old Lenovo G560 I used had the same audio and video hiccup issue with Linux Mint. The sound is similar to a CD skipping, if that makes sense. Not a Think product, but definitely from the office line of Lenovo laptops.

That awkward moment when I realized that I skippy skipped to Linux Mint over a Firefox issue. My previous state of mind in which Firefox could not no harm has been modified. Now my state of mind watches to make sure Firefox doesn't use 4-5G of RAM. Firefox user since when it was cool, and I'm sad now. Vivaldi's Firefox profile import tool tho 🔥
