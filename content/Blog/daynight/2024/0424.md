Three months tied to my Fitbit (Google) Sense 2, and here's my well sought after opinion (my pro-am, semi-pro, part-time reviewer opinions are my own).

> He's tough on watches this one (Spidgen

- 6/02/2024 - Calories burn rate adds +1000-1500 per day for some reason. I burn about 2200-2500 calories per day, and not 3-3.5K.

- 5/13/2024 - Speaker crackling. Sounds a lot like water damage. There's a menu option to switch it off, so that's good.

- Battery life longer than two days

- Easy to read screen that blanks surprisingly quickly

- Watch face ecosystem mostly co-opted by third parties

- Microphone for txt responses (idk, did not use it) or Alexa

- Remappable long button press (Alexa, weather, health statistics, etc.)

- Consistently poor sync with weather icon on watch face (¬∞_ _ _¬∞)

- Easy to clean & seems to handle rain well

- Emoji smileys all wearing headbands? Sports? Because sports?

I turned on all metrics, including the üîó[ECG monitor](https://www.fitbit.com/global/fi/technology/ecg "Fitbit | ECG"), and the mood thing. Neither have been especially helpful for my day to day other than the mood feature having a secondary effect of helping me to wake up. There's probably a very apt psychological term for the phenomenon. I'll call it, uh, the watch is now controlling my subconcious thoughts phenomenon.

> Help.

We'll see whether or not Google nerfs it with a firmware update. If early planned obsolesce then idk, switch to iOS? Ultra? Ultra.

> To be fair, Tigger's meows were always polite

### Back 2 Kubuntu

Yea, from all the posts I've read of people directing the Linux curious to Linux Mint, I thought it would be fine. What I kept running into is this strange disconnect between Linux Mint and Ubuntu incompatibilities. I'd imagine there may be a person reading this in the future saying to themselves, "Well duh, did you not read X?" No @person_of_the_futures_totally_real_profile_picture_prob_not_a_bot, but I wish I had read it.

> Tux on the desk is unaffected by this information.

I use an older Thinkcentre M73 (upgraded to an M93) as my main desktop computer. It sips on power, doesn't take a server grade UPS to keep it running, and allows me to get some work done. Since my desktop is part of the Lenovo's Think line of products (formerly IBM's line of products) I think it's reasonable to assume a good amount of compatibility with Linux operating systems. I'm not sure if the issue I faced is a compatibility issue. Audio and video occasionally hiccuped. It wasn't something I could predict, so I can reasonably believe the hiccups were not trigged by an app or script. It seemed more like the CPU scheduler prioritized networking and storage over audio and video. Of course we all know that my previous statement is riddled with speculation that would never hold to scrutiny in a court of law.

> An old Lenovo G560 I used had the same audio and video hiccup issue with Linux Mint. The sound is similar to a CD skipping, if that makes sense. Not a Think product, but definitely from the office line of Lenovo laptops.

That awkward moment when I realized that I skippy skipped to Linux Mint over a Firefox issue. My previous state of mind in which Firefox could not no harm has been modified. Now my state of mind watches to make sure Firefox doesn't use 4-5G of RAM. Firefox user since when it was cool, and I'm sad now. Vivaldi's Firefox profile import tool tho üî•

Non-Jabroni type post though. There's a modularity to Linux that makes it so damn intoxicating. In unrelated news, I have magically found myself back on Linux Mint. What?! How did I get here?!

Quick trackball nerd update. I tell myself I use trackballs because my wrists are jacked. The real reason is that I have forgotten how to mouse. The Elecom Huge ships with a foam palm wrist that retains a certain odor over time, so I modified it to stop doing that.

New website domain. This website was designed for an audience of one. Me. I also tap to like all my social media posts. Why would I post them if I didn't like them? That would be silly.

> Special shout-out to Holmes Heritage USB fan üåÄ

After configuring the domain I realized that the website format is not exactly what I was looking for. I like using Hugo and Github Pages to deploy the website. The thought has occurred to me to create a custom Hugo template. Though the time cost for that endeavour may outweigh the benefits of boutique'ing this website.

### Goosebumps #10

<div style="text-align: center;">

Reconnecting them old pathways can be as easy as buying a Goosebumps book. Also by 'wrecked' I meant that I broke down and cried like an anime character. The story is fucked up and it fucks me up every time I read it. But back in the 90s, it taught me a valuable lesson about fire. Other than fire hot.

> I'll read it again too. #bannedbooks

Working my way back to literary works of Robert Jordan, Tolkien, James S. A. Corey, and Stephen King to name a few.
