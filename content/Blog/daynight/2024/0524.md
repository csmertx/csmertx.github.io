Monetizing anything to do with this website seems like another dead end. So I don't plan to do that. I've had a drive to design and build stuff since a lot of years ago. I'd like to do more of that.

Nestor (aka Nessie) specialized in human resources while working for the local movie theater chain of Palm Beach County before going into karaoke hosting. She may have pretended to attend Florida Atlantic University. I never saw her study. Her supposed subject of interest was üîó [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Wikipedia | Anthropology"). She took notes during karaoke as part of an 'assignment'. She may have played World of Warcraft for similar reasons (Nessie).

<br>

The people in the image above are Jennifer Nestor and possibly Raymond Yuan (Chinese American--his family owned a Chinese restaurant in Palm Beach County). Nestor (aka Nessie) specialized in human resources while working for the local movie theater chain of Palm Beach County before going into karaoke hosting.

After mimicking her roommate in 2008 (I think her name is/was Lenny), she taught Nestor how to host karaoke events and Nestor used her to act like someone I might like to spend company with. She (Lenny?) also dated a guy named Rufus. After long distance dating for a few months, Nestor talked me into living in South Florida (Spring of 2008). While we were still dating (and her persona faded), she dated Yuan (he used my razor--she bragged about that) as I worked 90 hour weeks at Pompano Park via United Tote vendor. Operator by day and technician by night.

Yuan favors glocks, possibly hollow points (more stopping power, less likely to pierce threw walls), and probably has it concealed. He plays games like Oblivion, but he consistently appeared inpatient while attempting to extract information.

Nestor's new 'friend' is most likely someone from Boston (hence the Boston Red Sox earrings). Her telltale sign is when she occasional drops her persona or momentarily acquired accent. Ask her about her family's chicken and rice jingle. She may still have a large satellite group from Broward County that she conferences with for brain storming. Her hand flapping may be a technique used to seem less threatening for when her Scottish temper flairs. She also has a passion for spreading rumours or lying to her 'friends' which she uses to get responses, blackmail, extort, and exploit others kindness. In The Apprentice days (2008) of South Florida she would toss trash out of her vehicle while driving. They'll also hire people with impressive sound systems, limos, etc. for intimidation. So uh, yeah, I don't envy Yuan at all. Good luck dude.

They have created at least six fake names: Chris J. (not me), Adam (not my cousin), Max (not my cousin), Kc (not my brother), Jackie (not my sister), and Ronald Schammert. Novak may also be a last name of interest. Knowing jackals have infiltrated my family with their military draft dodging tendencies is something I'll die for to correct. They'll create more if they get an inroad into the Linux world. The houses those individuals have were purchased with money that does not belong to them.

Christopher J. Schammert (not me, üîó [this guy](https://facebook.com/chris.schammert)), and Max (not my cousin) married significant others and had children. Which is very unfortunate for the children. If they hadn't placed me through two years of hell I may have been able to take pity. You've help mold the person I am today. My trust is now earned through varies levels of tests. Schammerts are not lazy people. That's a difficult test for these people to pass.

I wouldn't doubt that they bought the house across the street. It was part of an attempted homicide investigation (local TV news was on this street). They also spent a lot of time remodeling (basically gutted), so it was probably really affordable. Block home, long but not wide front yard, and newly installed solar panels. Recently installed three small flood lights. Lots of little signals too. What neighbor would actually care enough to say something about an orange King Ghidorah shirt? They're the ONLY neighbors that have spoken to me directly since the beginning of the Pandemic too. She said it in such a snide tone. Like she was already disgusted about something. I scan while I'm everywhere, much like baby proofing and keeping a house baby proofed. My family does the same. If a neighbor comes up to me, while I'm out I'll be curt but polite. My mannerism will scream, "I'm busy. Leave me alone." It's difficult to tell based on how these fraudsters exchange information whether or not the people in the house next door are involved. There have been several üîó [shootings](https://mycbs4.com/news/local/high-springs-attempted-murder-suspect-arrested-on-gun-charges-in-gainesville "MyCBS4.com (WGFL) | Former High Springs attempted murder suspect arrested on gun charges in Gainesville") nearby since 2015. The one investigation I'm thinking about ended in Oak Glade Apartments, Gainesville, FL (2019?). I stayed there back in 2009. Nice cinder block courtyards.

I believe the üîó [letter](/Blog/daynight/2024/0724#wrapping-up "Day & Night Blog \ July 2024") I sent to FBI HQ through USPS was intercepted. That or sent to the most over burdened office. I'll keep trying. Multiple copies. Multiple offices. Multiple mail companies. Agents will know one way or another. If I or any of my family die, the investigation will lead here. I'd think twice before hiring someone to kill anyone. I'm treating this as if they've already killed a member of my family. It could be a romance scheme involving a distant relative, but you never know with people willing to live via assumed identities. Letters sent so far: Chicago: Nov. 8th, 2024 via post office, Jacksonville: Nov. 8th, 2024 via post office, NYC: Jul. 5th, 2024 via mailbox.

> This situation is a bit different from others, which is why I sent out letters. It's recommended to call your local agent.

Her uncle has used at least one his properties (1 to 2 room flat) to host at least some of those brainstorming meetings. Also a wannabe enforcer/pusher dude by the name of Tommy (big ears, pale skin, creepy stare, probably a Nestor or Novak, likes the company of people afraid of him, preferred vehicles that make him look 'gangster').

Tommy was sitting on the couch of that 'drug den' house. He was also present when I went to the Deerfield Beach, FL Subway for a tuna sub. I remember this because Jennifer Nestor answered the phone while we were chilling in 'our' room, seemed irate (screamed into the phone like a jackal), and I thought maybe she needed a bite to eat. She was most likely on the phone with Tommy. This was another underhanded intimidation tactic. He said nothing to me at that Subway sandwich shop, nor did he lock eyes with me for long. She didn't want half of my tuna sub.

The twin sized mattress I found still in a bag next to the dumpster at The Preserve at Deer Creek Apartments was probably an extra from the mattresses they used to stage that 'drug den' house. Same period of time (late spring early summer 2009) in which a limo appeared to drop stuff off. They had the password to enter that gated community.

I dropped Jennifer Nestor off at Florida Atlantic University (with her car), and she probably got a ride to that house (Oakland Park?) to brainstorm new tactics. I should have known something was up when she never had 'homework'. Everyone studies. Midterms, finals, etc.. She randomly stopped going to class. And no white collared property owner (her uncle) would look as composed as her uncle did inside a 'drug den' (Palm Beach County / Broward County). Unless he was surrounded by accomplices. IIRC his personal home is close to A1A. They also exploit weaknesses in others (in private) like love (me), drinking, hard drugs, sex, and are not afraid to extort and exploit if the opportunity is present. Everyone in that room looked like they were waiting for a meeting to start. One woman was sitting at a small breakfast type dining table (one chair) near the front entrance doing nothing at all. No texting, no solitaire, just observing.

These individuals also have no issues using tragic news stories to make gullible or vulnerable people feel guilty about their actions. Coercion as well.

And hurricane displacement is no excuse for their behaviors (hitchhiking on the family name). They weren't even displaced. And that $104,000 he put down on his house (10-4) was the most passive aggressive thing I've ever witnessed. When the time comes remember that he was your undoing. I'll keep this website up so that your children will know the truth as well. They didn't deserve any of this, and you know it.

And why did all this happen? Beats me. Could be some kind of rat race bet. "My Chris will beat the original Chris." Or maybe a bunch of people trying to make it seem like the rat race thing is happening. I'm not part of some reality TV show. And I'm not expecting something for nothing. I'm just existing.

### Original blog entry from: May 3, 2024.

<br>

For those that don't know, there is another Chris Schammert. From my chat with ChatGPT (I know..) the most likely way a family can jump ship and become another family is through a court of law (name change--usually requires a good reason). That whole 'branch' of the family name is missing much of the address history one would find while searching for a 33-39 year old adult. I was suspicious of another Chris Schammert back in 2009, but that was when I thought they were a cluster of fake Facebook accounts. When I saw the property deeds late 2023 was when I realized they were for real.

> Zero hubris, because they feel protected. I have a feeling that empathy is something they learned to mimic too. They're the kind to use empathy against others, so watch out for that. Anything and everything to maintain a smile, including using their own (if they even have children) as props--like they're in a movie. I imagine they also possess real world psychological problems with their own self manifested üîó[borderline personality disorder(s)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20370237 "Mayo Clinic | Borderline personality disorder - Symptoms and causes").

> Unsolicited book recommendation on the subject: üîó[_Ten Things I Hate About Me_](https://goodreads.com/book/show/59723412-ten-things-i-hate-about-me "Goodreads | Ten Things I Hate About Me") by Joe Tracini (cocaine addiction, etc. warning)

We sign up for stuff, rent apartments, or share a family home. And of course, that is recorded by the internet. It builds up overtime, and becomes public record. It's not typical for insurance fraud to go unchecked for that many years, with that many people. And it's not typical for there to be vast chunks of time missing from a person's public record. Also, the Schammert name got its start in the mid-west (Chicago, IL). Why live in the U.S. mid-west that far away from 'blood relatives'? With children to look after as well? I knew something smelled funny. Like a droopy sagging diaper that needs to be changed.

> Duplicate names of several real Schammerts going by public records. This typically does not happen in small families without the family sharing that like a serving of sausage and sauerkraut. Why an Anglo-Saxon male would use a two letter abbreviation for his first name is beyond my comprehension.

Yea, and this's where it gets real complicated really fast. I'm some poor dumb single dope living in the family's basement, so they're not worried about me. They shouldn't be worried about me. Actually, if it wasn't for my two years experience as a US rater and multiple years of showing an aptitude for relying on concrete evidence via these blog posts, they might have been able to convince the public that I am just some conspiracy theory nut. But hey, they have funding for attorneys, and I do not. I'm the least of their worries right?

> An attorney can take the time to call courts until eventually they find which court issued the last name change. Or distribution of court issued name changes (if that applies to the specific case). So if this is happening to you too, and you have the coin, you can build a case without too much fanfare. Though I'd imagine a court case of this scope would take a while.

Why did this all happen in the first place? I have no idea. Probably the same reason that microphone was (likely) deliberately left on a folding table at the upper level of the Isle of Capri Casino back in 2009. And this 'situation' has nothing to do with the late üîó[Bernard Goldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Goldstein_(casino_owner) "Wikipedia | Bernard Goldstein (casino owner)"). Probably the work of a very petty and narrow focused individual. Someone that probably calls South Florida their home (or one of their homes).

> That's roughly all I can say (legally) about the subject. Other than 'Chris' was buddies with Mike Hewlett (Broward County & Gainesville, FL) for a while. 'Chris' was in my apartment at Deerfield Beach, Florida. He looked like a jackal back then too.

Now if you'll excuse me from the table--I have some coffee to sip elsewhere.

### The Courage To Close One's Eyes (Part 2)

<br />

> Used Nike cleats that were a little too small, boat salesman sponsor on the hat, nervous hat bending, and another life time (1996)

<br />

</div><br />

I thought my meaning behind Part 1 was about as obvious as I could make it without saying it outright. When it's time for me to go, will I have the courage to close my eyes? So that no one will have to close them for me.

> I believe I will. Whether or not random audience members of this blog believe me is not something that concerns me at the moment.

Bunting was my specialty for some reason. Batting average was like 222? If by chance I won't give up the tradition of passing down baseball, but boy is it hard to watch the games without cable TV. Dude, $200+ a month for thousands of hours of programming I'm not going to watch? Why you do this baseball? Go watch a Cubs game for me. Have a beer or something. I don't drink, but that doesn't mean you can't.

> Tried pitching once. I nearly beamed the first batter up. Coach said nope, and I agreed.

Still AI Wrangling as best I can. A little bit everyday. Though it's very true that I couldn't afford a bed at a hostel, I can at least keep pushing forward. So grateful for that one Wired Magazine article that outlined the ways to work from home without a degree. I'm also still very thankful to those that believe in me. Thank you for being you.

> Bejeweled. Now what?

<br />

</div><br />

Some of the greatest bards of our era are power metalists. The very alchemists known to fix soul leakage. The crown shown above is mostly for shock value. I made it with some sweet cardstock, some off the shelf gold-like foil, and a few polycarbonate jewels. Pretty sweet eh?

> To be clear, the image above is to provide support for our new overlords. To ensure that I'll be eternally favored when they cast The Eye of Judgement spell. Perhaps I'll be an algae scrubber. Dude, I would scrub some algae. Hopefully they'll let me wear Crocs. Love that toe bumper protection. Kick-it in 4X4 too. Staying safe out here. Why folks bejewel your Crocs though? I bet it's secretly for the weight distribution huh? Yup, I knew it. I have a Morton's toe. I know what it's like to realign the Crocs to pull my toe back into them. I see you bejeweled Croc folks. Slight ninja flick of the ankle and bam the Crocs are realigned. Didn't even have to kick-it into 4X4 huh? Nice. You modified your EVA foam foot enclosures, and I'm not even mad. Frankly, I'm quite impressed with the flair too. Get it Crocs fam.

I'm not gonna lie, the emoji sidebar is beginning to get into my head. It's like the üîó[Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/ "Emojipedia.org") threw up on to my sidebar. Is there an MS Word for web authoring? Asking for a friend..

> I know I said HTML5 & CSS before. I know. How do people even sign up for those coding bootcamps? There's probably some snacks around here. I bet The Computer Chronicles would know what to do. Only one way to find out. Gotta watch it. Gotta watch the Computer Chronicles. For the science. For the love. For the üîó[pastamancers](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Pastamancer "Kingdom of Loathing Wiki | Pastamancer"). May the sauce be with you.

### There are four lights.

<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">

> Never five.

<br />

</div><br />

Alright, so I have an interesting theory. It's a very interesting theory. A very bespoke theory if you will.

> This is one of my speculative posts. Maybe take that grain a salt people are always bragging about.

What if one of the current U.S. Presidential Candidates--let's say one of the U.S. Presidential Candidates that has embraced open source communication tools like Mastodon--is using a large language model as a loyalty detection tool. One of the cheapo üîó [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model "Wikipedia \ Large Language Model") varieties. Nothing as grand as the system used by the üîó [CCP (aka CPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Wikipedia \ Chinese Communist Party"). Same spirit, different execution.

> "Spared no expense of course. It prints a report for me every four hours, and I can post about the disloyalty at my leasure." -Unknown

By cheapo I mean it probably does not have a vision processing routine. So in theory, this LLM would scrape all video transcripts and text, but no routines to decipher body language. It wouldn't know a head nod from a grand 'fish size' hand gesture.

> In theory, a candidate can show solidarity with the U.S. Constitution and avoid detection by a simple nod of the head.

If a free car showed up in the driveway I'd call to have it towed. The city can use that money for something useful.

> "Ok, I'll need exactly three Capri Suns and two large pizzas if you want the job done right." -Unknown

{{< expand "Nerd Joke" "‚ñº" >}}

> üîó [Azure-ly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure "Wikipedia \ Microsoft Azure") you must be joking!

{{< /expand >}}

And can we chill on the "Fuck them boats" rhetoric? Some of 'them boats' are moving my packages to U.S. America. We need them boats.

> If you wondering why infrastructure is going haywire maybe keep in mind the lapse of maintenance follow ups happening during and shortly after the COVID-19 Pandemic (Baltimore, Boeing, etc.). Fewer people to do the same amount of work = more unfortunate accidents.

So that's my theory anyway. Hope everyone has a good day / night.

> This post was directly inspired by the voices that keep me from sleeping. The echoes of my past perhaps. üîó [You're doing terrific](/Blog/daynight/2024/images/letterkenny_youre_doing_terrific.gif).

### The Kulturkampf was the beginning.

<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">

<br />

</div><br />

üîó [Kulturkampf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulturkampf "Wikipedia \ Kulturkampf") - Cultural struggle (1871‚Äì1878)

Great Great Grandpa Herman Schammert, Great Great Grandma Marie Schammert, and lil Great Grandpa Herman Schammert left Prussia during the first ripple of strife that traveled by river to Southern Prussian. This cultural struggle--one in which religious consolidation was a pivotal hinge--was no doubt why they left Prussia in 1881. Along with consolidation of any kind comes complications. In a less perfect world, the one in which we actually exist in at this current moment in time, the complications were, hold on let me finish this sentence first. Ok, mischief is like a cat swatting a cup off a table. I think we can all agree that is a very appropriate use of the word mischief. Complication is not the appropriate use of the word in this context.

> Complication is like when shit is stuck in the toilet and you have to make it unstuck from the toilet.

Some of the worst aspects of human nature were on display in Prussia during the late 1800s. The first echos of serial killers, and maniacs in power throwing humiliation parties as a display of their absolute power. Of course, documentation of such events were so riddled with corruption people may have been willing to pretend they were blind just to survive the times. Not just religious consolidation my friends. Consolidation of culture into a üîó [Unified Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Germany "Wikipedia \ Unification of Germany"). We all know that Prussia was absorbed into the great collective. So much so, that future families of Prussian immigrants would be ridiculed in U.S. America for not knowing their own heritage. "You mean, you're from Germany right?" No.
