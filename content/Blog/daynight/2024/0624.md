While they--mentioned here üîó [Day & Night Blog \ Chris Schammert](/Blog/daynight/2024/0524#chris-schammert)--scramble to erase their tracks, I felt it would be irresponsible for me to NOT mention one of their potential hiding spots. I prefer science fiction and fantasy genres. So I'm not locked some type of true crime show generated conspiracy theory because someone bumped me in line or something.

Since <u>Runes of Magic</u> is owned by üîó [Gameforge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameforge "Wikipedia.org \ Gameforge"), a German company, it would probably be trivial for higher U.S. Authorities to obtain chat log files from the <u>U.S. American server: Ayvenas US</u>. I'd imagine those log files go back several years. <u>I'd start with the toon Bugsbunny or Sirlixalot</u>. I'm not sure if the person behind the <u>Amy toons</u> is part of it, but that might be a path of interest as well. The üîó [Amymage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuC9-DgF-k4 "YouTube | RoM: Akeli The Sage Day #42 (Amymage appearance)") toon was used to troll me (3:33) as I was working on a virtual deer hunting project (December 26, 2023: before 12:38PM). 'Toon' Lunablacklight was consistently parked in Varanas East (inside NPC vendor stalls) to pull my attention. I think it's them because I posted a 24 day progress picture of the hunting project to Discord and toons began showing up to make it seem like I should try something else. The hunting spot became super busy, and someone was attempting to unnerve me nearly every time I hunted (starting from the 25th day). The typical player generally respects the grind and would encourage the farming of rare world bosses (200+ hour farming missions). Especially one without a YouTube video filmed by a player \(üîó [Akeli, the sage](https://runesofmagic.fandom.com/wiki/Akeli,_the_sage "Runes of Magic \ Fandom \ Akeli, the sage")\). OGs would at the very least respect a person warning others they're recording a YouTube video of that magnitude. I tried a few different translations thinking one of them didn't understand English, and no response (I once roamed with Turkish players in üîó [Allods Online](https://allods.my.games/en "Allods.my.games -- steep paywall")). It was as if making a video of that project would not be good for their wallets. They were very sloppy with their words, so I imagine IP addresses would be a thing that can be traced back to them. Why hide your tracks when you think you're dealing with an idiot?

I'd wager a <u>chat log search for "house burned down" or some permutation of that (2022-2023) will reveal their sob story over and over again.</u> One of them private messaged me with a smurf toon as I ran them through Goblin Games--continued to msg me as I did my Wailing Fjord dailies (Upbear: July 2022 is when I started Wailing dailies--my login would start with 35-45 minutes for mini games and daily quests). I think that's how they're getting away with not having photo evidence of their past. A very simple to repeat sob story. Someone showed up at the door today at 3:40pm with a similar fake sob story, which reminded me about the story I read from a random toon in 2022 (I have a voice recording of the person that appeared at the door and can easily pick him out of a lineup). Today was when I realized there might be a connection between these (very white) folks and Runes of Magic.

Judging by their social media accounts they seem like the type that don't like the outdoors very much. Like they're terrified that a wasp or bee will sting them at any moment. Personally, I'd label them armed and incompetent. In 2013 I was jobless, very hungry, and desperate for a pathway to pull myself up by my bootstraps. So I joined Runes of Magic. My social skills were worn down quite a bit in 2013. I thought maybe communicating in a way people can't see my face would help. It was like a club to me. A place to talk to other like minded people. Or so I thought they were like minded. <u>My last two toons (accounts) were Upbear (Oct 2022), and Ghem (Oct 2023)</u>.

Little did I know how organized I'd become in real life because of that game. I wouldn't recommend joining the game now because it's full of the types that would let a person drown because jumping in the water would mean getting their clothes wet. I have very personal reasons for feeling this way. And it's not because of red state blah blah blah. I care for none of that. Republicans took me in to their home when I was 18, and I will never forget their kindness. I also grew up with Republican's kids in Hawthorne, Florida. We played X-Men together and everything. On the 6th I visited one of my favorite places in Hawthorne, Florida (Holden Pond). It's not the same pond anymore, but it was nice to visit for a few hours anyway.

Ole white eyes, if you're reading this, I'm sorry. I had a really nasty bonk on the head during an awkward phase. It wasn't your fault, you just caught me by surprise.

___

Seriously though, back to the people behind this operation. If I had a child, I would do everything in my power to keep these people away. They give me those creepy vibes that are difficult to shake. I have my reasons for thinking this way. This is well beyond the safety of just a few people. And I'm not sure they understand that concept.

___

Whomever hired these people, if that's how it all started anyway, was severely ripped off. That reminds me, in 2009 I thought all the affluent people lived in Miami. Palm Beach County was nearby where I worked in Pompano Beach, and no one mentioned anything about celebrities. I walked by the yachts moored near A1A and still had no idea if a TV celeb lived within a hundred miles. I just recently learned in the past few years that üîó [Mar-a-Lago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago "Wikipedia.org \ Mar-a-Lago") is a place where people live.
___

Back then I was too busy trying to get a paycheck. Like most other U.S. Americans.

Actual evidence?

No Schammert would _EVER_ ignore the Facebook message that I sent these people: "To all paries involved: I want none of your tainted money, favors, or help. Your silence is \[what\] we needed. Please be smart about this, and please take care of yourselves. For those reading this message later, if any of my blood relatives die (including myself), it won't be from suicide."
