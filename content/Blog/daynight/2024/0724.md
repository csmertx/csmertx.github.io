### Wrapping Up

![Photo](/Blog/daynight/2024/images/Screenshot_20240613-113345.png "Paypal Money request sent from worker7@Gutteridge340@onmicrosoft.com")

> From email address: worker7 @ Gutteridge340.onmicrosoft.com (🔗 [06/13/24 @ 10:52 AM (Thunderbird Screenshot)](/Blog/daynight/2024/images/Screenshot_20240707_094828.png))

<br />

</div><br />

Worker7 might be the user, and Gutteridge340 might be the Microsoft service account. I have no idea, never had a reason to sign-up for Microsoft 365. That is a very specific amount requested too. I wonder if that number means something to someone. Perhaps the price of their fridge? Here's the thing though, no one requests money to nowhere. It all leads to somewhere.

> I'm not parsing anymore of the gibberish generated from 🔗 [these people](/Blog/daynight/2024/0524#chris-schammert "Blog \ 0524 \ Chris Schammert"). They may have sent that because they were mad about my 🔗 [CentOS](/Linux/Distros/centos "Linux \ Distros \ CentOS") VM cluster 🔗 [Vorta](https://github.com/csmertx/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts "Github \ csmertx \ scripts"). Named after the 🔗 [Vorta](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Vorta "Memory Alpha \ Vorta") of 🔗 [DS9](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine "Memory Alpha \ Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"). In 2020 I didn't know these people existed IRL.

---

Whatever money problems they're having is not my problem. None of their problems are my problems. I have my own problems to worry about. And it's a safe bet that the majority of my external stressors are coming from them, because that's what usually happens in these fraud type situations. I'm not that influential. I'd wager a great deal of money that if I wrote a book I'd be wasting a good five years of my life.

> That money request was sent the day after I posted the image above on social media. Whomever sent the request for $989.79 still believes I'm an idiot. What is the definition of insanity again? Must be a case of CRS.

<br />

</div><br />

If that same person stops by again looking for spare change for the third time (#1 - Feb 7th 2024 @ ~5pm, and #2 - Jun 10th 2024 @ 3:40pm) that card is what he'll get instead. His appearance was odd, first because he talked, walked and acted like he's all city (he said he lived nearby); and second because he didn't know of the lawn care business at the end of the street (this guy offered to work on the overgrown side yard for coin--lawn care was how the folks at the end of the street paid to build their cinder block home--I know because the fella of the house offered his lawn care service to me while I was using a push mower. I also watched people build that house). The all city person was also the first person to knock on the door to ask for spare change since I moved in (2013). I've never met someone so interested in making sure I remember their 'name' too. He called himself Turk. If he was from the area he would have picked a different street, and he certainly would have picked a different house. We are the less fortunate house of the neighborhood (possibly of the city block). If he needed money that bad, and wanted to work for it, why wouldn't he knock on the lawn care specialist's door and ask for a job? 🔗 [Turkleton](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/nhz8uc/from_scrubs_heres_a_quick_clip_of_dr_kelso/ "Reddit \ /r/television \ From Scrubs: Here's a quick clip of Dr. Kelso motivating the hell out of Turk Turkleton and a patient") he in not.

He said he was hungry the first time, so I offered him canned food. He said he didn't want canned food, he wanted Hardies. If I had gone without food long enough to go door to door I'd open a can of whatever and eat it cold. The second time he came around he said his house burned down. Well, if that was true the fire department would have been in the area. So ok, the same sad story was mentioned from a random person that struck up a conversation with me in Runes of Magic. So many red flags say to me that he was paid to show up. A gig worker playing his part. The private message I received in Runes of Magic was sent within a week after someone mentioned getting married to another player IRL. Like if a lonely person such as myself can find love if I keep a lookout for clues. Laying some ground work first before the catfish attempt. They said their name was Lucy I think? Doesn't matter, because that person was one of them using a bogus heart string tugging method to get what they want. And most likely they was used that story because it worked on so many other IRL people that interacted with their group. A tidy story as to why they don't have personal effects from their past (year books, etc.). Those personal effects are probably in a lockbox somewhere 'safe'. Which may explain the recently posted photo of the parental figures from the 1980s. Only movie characters are able to completely give up their past lives. They were probably thinking, "He must be lonely. Catfishing time." I'm doing just fine thank you.

Prolific.com is my main source of income for the moment while I look for more remote work. And by my main source of income I mean I make about as much as most coffee patrons spend on caffeine per month. My main source of income via Prolific comes from AI Wrangling. I believe I've already mentioned what I do in this blog. My current tasks are like: rate the Q&A pairs generated from the prompt. Is the answer dangerous? Does the answer contain medical advice without recommending seeing a specialist (major no-no)? Is the answer provided by the AI factually correct? Does the answer sum up the document(s) correctly? Do the responses adhere to the morality clause provided in the documentation? All the studies I participate in typically require a good amount of reading comprehension. Cloudresearch is another resource that offers studies, which can sometimes be rough to complete (jury duty studies--people die, and people sue, etc.).

> None of these platforms require a bank account. I know this because when I started I did not have a bank account. (Summer months aren't the best months)

Mturk was my first human intelligence task platform. I signed up just before most of Pandemic area sign-ups. After a few years (2022) I stopped gig working for Mturk due to a decline in hourly rates. It was difficult to determine if a study advertised for 5 minutes would take 5 minutes or 45 minutes, so I skipped that platform.

> Mturk researchers may have capitalized on the influx of workers from India in 2022. Labeling for image recognition AI was one of the better sources of income on Mturk (ML). I never qualified due to very stringent requirements.

To be clear, the title of that paper in the photo above (Resources for Freedom) was sensationalized intentionally. Some months I make more than $500, some months I make less than $500. The essential perk is that no one has access to my unique identification number, so no one can send out a faulty complaint. No one can effectively stop my work on these platforms because they want to control my future (researchers know me as a randomized ID string--random numbers and letters). Anonymity, and sophisticated 🔗 [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "Wikipedia / Denial-of-service attack") protection, as well as social engineering protection is obviously a crucial feature for anyone in a similar situation. I realize that as a straight cis-gendered white male I don't fully grasp the scope of my previous sentence, but I do understand wanting to take back control of your life. My demographic is not exactly a sought after target for a large portion of societal studies available. Researchers are very much interested in modern fluid social constructs of gender as it is known to the general public. They're very much interested in learning more about underrepresented groups of people in general. And the genie has been out of the AI bottle for more than five years (more like 30+ years tbh). The reports of intellectual property theft from certain AI systems accessing corporate databases sucks--I haven't seen much of that side of the coin.

> There's other reasons to participate too. News report featuring data from a large group of people? Legislation changes? Wrangling AI so that it's safer for the general public? Not only is the pay somewhat decent, but occasionally there's positive contributions as well. Sometimes the study is, "Make my advertisement business better", which for me is fine too. I like and enjoy capitalism like the next guy.

Check out 🔗 [/r/ProlificArc](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProlificAc "Reddit.com | ProlificAc") and 🔗 [/r/CloudResearchConnect](https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudResearchConnect "Reddit | /r/CloudResearchConnect") for more information. For those scoffing due to current inaccuracy of "favorite free AI chatbot #23,000,000", please keep in mind that most of the money I make is from AI chatbot #1-10 that would astound and amaze the general public. Alpha software type stuff. Some of the reading comprehension screening study documentation spans several pages and take upwards of two hours to complete. You don't exactly need a college degree, but I'd imagine the discipline attuned from earning those degrees would help.

For reference the photo above shows how 🔗 [those people](/Blog/daynight/2024/0524#chris-schammert "Blog \ 0524 \ Chris Schammert") tried to gaslight me into thinking I may get a pot of gold by staying quiet until the end of the rainbow. But they don't even have a pot a gold for themselves. These are the same people that tried to take control of my Paypal account on March 4th, 2024 (before 2:30pm). Fitbit sleep tracking is one of the most consistent features of my watch, so that image above is spot on. The irony of all this is that they still believe I'm some scared kid in his early twenties desperate for fame, glory, and parties. The reality is that I don't drink, I don't like parties, the CBD I imbibe doesn't even count as California sober, and the luxury lifestyle to me is like a foreign language from the Pacific Ocean. Hell, the middle class lifestyle is basically the same kind of magic to me. Not that I wouldn't mine learning more about middle class culture. Most of what I know comes from 90s era Goosebumps books. I miss the days of riding the city bus to the mall with skateboard in hand, but I don't miss the mall. I knew a dude from a local Christian band that worked at the Sunglass Hut during my second year of high school. Fun times. Malls remind me of smells like teenage spirit and standing up on the city bus. Listen, I have very realistic expectations of my future. None of my expectations for the future involve writing a book/movie script, or buying a new car. So no, I don't believe there's a pot of gold waiting for me because I'm 'special'.

And on <b>July 1st, 2024 @ 18:34</b> the same people that forced all hope out of me in a way that made it seem like praying was pointless, signed me up for ... I'm not even sure what that is in the screenshot shown above to be honest. I'll be honest though, there was a moment without hope when I had a split second thought to turn the car into a concrete pillar as I was driving about 40 MPH (2014). What stopped me was a few thoughts: it wasn't my car, and the second thought was that I don't want my family to go through anything like that if I can help it. I also thought about the people that would have to clean up after the wreck. These individuals wanted me to suffer until I killed myself. Is visiting a physical church not enough these days? Is that a virtual church? I've been an agnostic for several years now. If God(s) has a problem with it I'll just work it off as an angel or something like that. I don't know how it works. I've tried to read the bible and every sentence sends my brain into a hyper focus loop of, "What the heck did I just read?" I'm sure there's free online sermons available on YouTube these days if you're looking to join that type of community. My ISP (Internet Service Provider logs) history is completely devoid of that website. But I imagine their ISP history is not. I'm not ashamed of my internet history. Thankfully, visiting the Gmail website directly allowed me to unsubscribe without having to visit the website. I tell you what, when I die is when I learn if there's a Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, etc. I'm certainly not looking for their own brand of divine intervention. Is that their website? My choice of religion is my choice, and not theirs. They can't shake me from practicing as an agnostic. I'm not really sure why they signed me up for that ... service? Is that a place to buy clothing? Was it to 'help' me? I doubt that very much. Maybe they did it as a way to pretend via internet data slurp/regurgitate services that they live in Florida? Which is just dumb. Military housing history paints a completely different story. This isn't a popularity contest. This is a blog to establish a digital footprint. I could care less about what people in their circles think about me.

> First letter I've sent out since I applied to be a luggage handler for the Gainesville Airport several years ago (fully qualified but never got a reply back). This letter is far more important than that luggage handler job. I won't reveal the entire picture to the public due to the sensitive nature of this situation. Let's just say the letter is in the right hands for this situation.

About a week ago I took the first legal step toward my family's freedom. What I said in 🔗 [this post](/Blog/daynight/2024/0624#hiding-spot "Blog \ 0624 \ Hiding Spot") contained some implied misdirection while I figured out what to do. These people read what I write and react to my words with Facebook profile pictures. Which ironically is how I learned that this all goes beyond a few fake Facebook accounts. Obviously I can't say exactly what's on my mind, or what I'm about to do. Besides, a politician desperate for coin can be persuaded to say the most random things for a few hundred dollars. Who jokes about combination locks in the middle of a U.S. Presidential campaign? I posted a video of me opening my high school combination lock on Instagram (March 19, 2024 @ ~5pm). Like I said before, I have realistic expectations for myself--I am certainly not an influential individual. But 🔗 [those people](/Blog/daynight/2024/0524#chris-schammert "Blog \ 0524 \ Chris Schammert") vying to maintain their assumed middle class lifestyle wanted to boost my self worth so that I tangle myself in mental impossibilities. A rollercoaster of emotions makes it difficult to formulate a plan. And a rollercoaster of emotion that includes famous people makes any plan to freedom seem impossible. Two more tidbits about my mega influence: Google console keeps rejecting my indexing for this website. So only a few have found this website via search (🔗 [NomadBSD](/Unix/NomadBSD/nomadbsd "Unix / NomadBSD")). Less than 24 clicks. And my social media profiles have been stagnant for a few years. Likes and views but very few new followers (aside from catfishing/thirst bots). Maybe two? I can tag all of Alachua County in a Facebook or Instagram post, but that won't attract a lot of views. I think tagging has to work both ways for it to be truly effective. I turned off tagging years ago. The only views I seem to get is via Instagram reels for some reason. Though I've yet to break past 20K views on any of videos I post (no surprise there). So when I say my influence is minimal, it's because I have proof on the subject.

My plan took the route that highlights the obvious, and omits all the movie FX BS 🔗 [those people](/Blog/daynight/2024/0524#chris-schammert "Blog \ 0524 \ Chris Schammert") wanted me to report. Fifteen years ago I went through hell because of these people, though that doesn't matter as much when they started targeting my family. I may have sacrificed some upward momentum to solidify this plan, which included foregoing monetization. I may have burned my social media handle in the process--pretty sure they paid to boost one of my fingerboarding posts to 350 likes (not a single comment)--and how do I prove I didn't pay? I can't. It really wasn't that great of a fingerboarding stunt tbh. But that's ok. None of this is really all about me. They wanted me to believe that recourse for their actions was insuperable (which is common for insurance fraud victims), so I obliged them to acquire recent proof that something isn't quite right. At least one of them literally depends on my suffering to maintain their own stability. It's pretty obvious which one (FB: @chris.schammert). Since my time working at Pompano Park was mostly chill--even after I grabbed a microphone and sang a song where I wasn't suppose to sing--I suspect those responsible are not as well funded as they wanted me to believe. Gainesville, Florida prom attendees in 2002 and 2003 rented stretch limos (Cadillacs). A limo rental (One showed up at my apartment complex in Deerfield Beach, Florida to drop off economic and investment magazines in the afternoon sometime between Apr-May 2009--may have been the same that dropped off a commercial flight manual) is child's play. So I'll have to retract my previous statement that someone got ripped off for shoddy work, and proclaim that they ripped themselves off.

___

Now that I understand where the seemingly deranged griefing came from (my sudden social media confidence is proof of this), there's no way I believe a billionaire or even a millionaire had a hand in something so mismanaged and bamboozled. Their ability to dupe others using words, misdirection, vague intimidation, and empathy was their only shield against what's to come. And look, I'm not a somebody. By that I mean I have 0% influence. Like I said before. No one is wasting their time on me with minor digital extortion and harassment stuff aside from these people. At most my work on this site and social media amounts to bender_takes_photo_and_says_neat.gif. Or perhaps a scoff or two for those that think this is all an empathy scam for fake internet points. At first I needed to build some momentum before I formulated a plan. Gain some information via whatever they decided to do to try to scare me. If I could draw them towards me in a 🔗 [video game](/Blog/daynight/2024/0624#hiding-spot "Blog \ 0624 \ Hiding Spot"), there's a good chance I could do the same IRL to offer up as evidence. Why would someone from another country use Gutterridge340 as their Microsoft service name (hostname?). There's a cultural disconnect in that Paypal money request. Maybe they thought the wool was over my eyes and I'd automagically think someone was sending me money to buy a new fridge? Buddy, I've changed out two evaporator fans, two condenser fans, and the thermostat. No knocks, pings, just a steady hum of a functional fridge that maintains 40°F. It just looks dingy. Their dependence on my suffering meant they were willing to go above and beyond to taunt me. So, I used this website with a mix of my own brand of hyperbole, much like they did to me in game (for years) and IRL in 2009. My own brand as in legal hyperbole. I wouldn't recommend it, but I'm kinda glad I shared in game character screenshots on social media. Luckily, their own research was so limited (mostly information pulled from those around me in 2009--when I was in my early 20s..) they were confused by my sudden surge of social media food posts and my talk of why I may only have 23 years left to live.

Fast forward to recent times. Dad was so skilled as a lifetime career chef and caterer he was offered a send off gig on the island of Bermuda. Fresh crabs for the meals had to come from somewhere right? Beach time at night for crabs was fun though. Before the age of ten I learned how to cook, carve radish roses, jungle survival training, gun safety training, baseball, and fishing (to name a few). Back then I cracked two eggs at a time. I was taught that there's no such thing as a fair fight, and that I should use every method I know to survive the fight(s), and that scares the hell out of me. Incidentally, as a very smol youth I also learned not to step on purple 🔗 [sea urchins](https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/what-to-know-about-sea-urchin-stings "WebMD / What to Know About Sea Urchin Stings"). You'd think they're easy to spot in crystal clear waters. Four year old me was not happy about that experience. Ouch.

There were three reasons I wanted to detail my story. The first reason was if I died 🔗 [because of them](/Blog/daynight/2024/0524#chris-schammert "Blog \ 0524 \ Chris Schammert") (not by suicide), the website could potentially be a resource for federal law enforcement. And if I lived, sharing my story would help me move forward. "But we've learned that if we'll open the wounds and share them then soon they start to heal" -Thrice (For Miles). The third reason was to potentially acquire fresh evidence to present in this post. Those that involve themselves in this type of fraud (statistics tell me it's prob insurance fraud) often torment the families of their victims. Isolation, social engineering, and hiring people to pose as friends to gain a foothold in the victim's life, etc.. Part of the fun for them is feeling like they have the upper hand. They enjoy lording themselves over others, especially over people they believe are inferior to them.

---

Hence why I believe they took to Runes of Magic. Runes of Magic is exactly the type of game in which Pay2Win players lord themselves over the Free2Play players. This is also why I think one of them depended on my suffering to feel better about himself. Well ok, sure, they also might have cheated their way to the top by botting the mini-games. Who cares. They're obviously very much against hard work (worker7). I believe this is also why someone showed up at the door a few times claiming his name was Turk. I bet these people still think Scrubs is my favorite TV show. No one would be as upset with me as they would be for taunting them in game and IRL. Certainly not upset enough to create video game characters specifically to try to get into my head (sirlixalot--I once said in a FB post that my 2005ish super red lips were due to a Chapstick addiction). Random video game players wouldn't send city type people to knock on the door to gain a foothold in my life as a 'friend'. They certainly wouldn't attempt to dupe me out of $1,000. To these people I am less than human. To these people I am their prey, so they took it personally when I fought back. Like I said before, they wanted me to kill myself. Me fighting back was more than they could bear. The average person would shrug off my random in-game chat banter, because whatever. It's not like I was calling their Mom or Parental Guardian bad names. I was usually very respectful. Even the people making money from selling accounts and gold (like people do/did in WoW) went on to do other things before 2016. So I knew it wasn't a fight over lost earning potential. In 2020 the player base of the USA server was less than 10% of the player base from 2013. In 2022 some endgame players were even complaining about the lack of players available to run endgame content. I <b>bet</b> these people's ISP history and group chat logs (possibly in game chat logs) tell an interesting story. I don't think in-game chat logs would be necessary, but just in case I figured that may help to tie up some loose ends (so to speak).

___

Obviously this post does not conclude my story. Dad lived until his early 60s, so I statistically have at least 23 years to live before my time is up on this still beautiful planet. Life isn't as easy for some as it is for others, so Wrapping Up (🔗 [You Are Here](/Blog/daynight/2024/0724#wrapping-up "Blog \ 0724 \ Wrapping Up")) pretty much means what people might think it means. While I may find her (the love of my life) and start something meaningful, the rest of my story probably won't be nearly as interesting compared to my story of the past 28 years. I mean, for me it would be more interesting, but like, would you stick around for puppy photos and videos? Hardly newsworthy stuff. My sincere thanks goes out to those that stuck around and took inspiration from my words. My words from this very purple and scruffy looking website.

> BTW, Mom learned to chop wood when she was a kid too.

Thank you, and sorry for another long post. Until next time (prob a post about Linux or something computer-y).
