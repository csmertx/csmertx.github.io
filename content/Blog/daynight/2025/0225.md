Create a highly detailed and realistic depiction of what humans (or the dominant hominid species) might look like in 6000 years, based on scientific speculation and evolutionary trends. The scene should show a futuristic humanoid figure with adaptations to advanced technology, environmental changes, and potential space colonization.

Key features to include:

- A tall, slender physique with optimized body proportions for efficiency and reduced energy consumption.

- Larger, almond-shaped eyes with enhanced vision capabilities, possibly adapted to low-light environments or different light spectrums.

- Smooth, almost translucent skin with subtle bioluminescent patterns, reflecting genetic modifications or adaptations to new environments.

- A slightly elongated skull, suggesting increased brain capacity or altered neural structures.

- Minimal body hair, with sleek, streamlined features for improved thermoregulation.

- Enhanced limbs with subtle biomechanical elements, such as reinforced joints or integrated technology.

- A futuristic, minimalist outfit made of advanced materials, possibly self-repairing or adaptive to environmental conditions.

The background should depict a futuristic cityscape or extraterrestrial environment, with advanced architecture, floating structures, and a blend of natural and artificial elements. The overall tone should be both awe-inspiring and scientifically plausible, emphasizing the evolutionary journey of humanity.

If we can keep Terra's atmosphere intact long enough anyway. We're at least one lifetime away from a one way mission to Mars. The budget constraints alone are a major hurdle. I mean, the mission is essentially tossing human beings and 100s of billions of dollars into space and hoping for the best.

üîó [Aerotrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerotrim "Wikipedia.org | Aerotrim") ride was my favorite of all rides. According to ChatGPT I have an issue with rollercoasters because I don't like giving up control. Yep, that and pre-computer simulated physics code enforcement relied on gumption and imagination. In the words of Alachua County residents: Ah, heck Naw.

This is coming from the same dude that used slides backwards as a kid. Was I not suppose to run up the slide, jump off the platform, and somersaut the landing? Whoops.

And holy interceptions Batman. I can't focus long enough for an entire football game and all--I saw the instant replays tho.
