I've used Windows 11 for nearly 30 days. I began this blog as a hardliner Linux desktop user (since 2018). I used an alternate personal computer operating system mostly for practical reasons, and after a while it became second nature. Tuned for low system specs. I was low system spec man for years. I mean, you can switch out car engines, why not computer software engines? Anyway, I've also worked from Linux desktops since 2020. Work required me to use web apps in Chrome. Nothing all that advanced tbh. Actually, I never communicated with my coworkers. No requirement for apps like: Teams, Skype, Slack, etc.. It's not that I dislike people or anything--it's just--I may have trust issues. I've applied root rot paint to those trust issue stems, and now I'm waiting for the roots to rot away. I wish I could be one of those people that dives headfirst into new social situations. Good for them dude. I guess I am a neanderthal. So it goes.

I'm not seeing anything that is cause for concern with my copy of Windows 11. Uptime looks decent. The screenshot above shows 11 days. While using Linux Mint I'd have to restart my desktop computer at least once a week. I'd know when to restart the PC when the graphical glitches began. And to be fair, I'm not exactly a Linux System Administrator. Not sure how that career path would have went to be honest. "I know, not presentable enough. I get it." The reason I was promoted at CVS was because everyone loves the person that volunteers to get China 6. A casual, "Hey, I'm going to China 9, anyone want anything?" is sometimes all it takes. And I showed up to unload the truck at 3AM. That helped.

Alright, I think I'm kinda stuck in Windows 11 for a bit. Everything is a challenge with this guy. At least until I build out a sane computer workstation. I need to address my drive to create. Even if only for personal growth. It may be time for an x86 or ARM based utility PC. It's strange how a minor slip up like falling into Windows 11 for work has tickled old synapses. I'm rolling with it to see where it takes me.
