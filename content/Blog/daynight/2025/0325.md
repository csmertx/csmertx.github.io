### Super Awesome Blog Title

I've used Windows 11 for nearly 30 days. I began this blog as a hardliner Linux desktop user (since 2018). I used an alternate personal computer operating system mostly for practical reasons, and after a while it became second nature. Tuned for low system specs. I was low system spec man for years. I mean, you can switch out car engines, why not computer software engines? Anyway, I've also worked from Linux desktops since 2020. Work required me to use web apps in Chrome. Nothing all that advanced tbh. Actually, I never communicated with my coworkers. No requirement for apps like: Teams, Skype, Slack, etc.. It's not that I dislike people or anything--it's just--I may have trust issues. I've applied root rot paint to those trust issue stems, and now I'm waiting for the roots to rot away. I wish I could be one of those people that dives headfirst into new social situations. Good for them dude. I guess I am a neanderthal. So it goes.

> Potato of workstation PCs. Low wattage tho

I'm not seeing anything that is cause for concern with my copy of Windows 11. Uptime looks decent. The screenshot above shows 11 days. While using Linux Mint I'd have to restart my desktop computer at least once a week. I'd know when to restart the PC when the graphical glitches began. And to be fair, I'm not exactly a Linux System Administrator. Not sure how that career path would have went to be honest. "I know, not presentable enough. I get it." The reason I was promoted at CVS was because everyone loves the person that volunteers to get China 6. A casual, "Hey, I'm going to China 9, anyone want anything?" is sometimes all it takes. And I showed up to unload the truck at 3AM. That helped.

> I may have dabbled with Limewire Photoshop in the past. Who's to know?

Alright, I think I'm kinda stuck in Windows 11 for a bit. Everything is a challenge with this guy. At least until I build out a sane computer workstation. I need to address my drive to create. Even if only for personal growth. It may be time for an x86 or ARM based utility PC. It's strange how a minor slip up like falling into Windows 11 for work has tickled old synapses. I'm rolling with it to see where it takes me.

### Keep the Supposition To Yourself

<br />

My brain wants to connect the dots to help me out with my lack of peer interaction. And seriously, I'm not bitter or jealous or even mad about the dissolving of previous friendships. These things I take as part of life. I've always been a survivor, and so I move on instead of stew within my own emotions. Plus, it may have been for their good as well as my own.

> I hope y'all are doing well. I don't follow anyone on social to prevent awkward unemployed moments, so I wouldn't know without direct contact.

The main purpose of posting this is not that I tend to avoid the voices. The voices don't compel me to do anything. And I'm not here to tell you that voices are a natural part of isolation. Though that's what I tend to believe. I mean, my work has been directly responsible for the taking down of hundreds of fake 'gummy' advertisements. That's mostly what I did was professional fake gummy ad takedowns. That and the scammy weight loss ads too. I'll say once again that conspiracy theories are just too expensive both mentally and financially for me to jump on board. And I know when my brain is trying to bullshit me.

> Especially when I've taken a gummy. I once woke up with an entire auditorium of voices all taking about me crawling back to bed. Dried herb is enough for me üòÇ

Alright, so that supposition thing applies to the outside world as well. Anything that is too good to be true probably isn't true right? An old axiom, but one that is equivalent to my weight in gold. If I read or hear the name Chris Schammert, Christopher Roy Schammert, or even cmsertx, then I know something is going down for sure. But without that crucial component, I'm not going to mentally hold on to things to chew on them later. I'm not going to take it as a sign from the great gods of the internet that I have been chosen for a secret mission. Nor will I be taking any random impromptu trips to confess my love to anyone. Listen, I like movies as much as the next person but I'd rather my life be a documentary or a biography rather than a movie narrative you know?

> Unless by love I mean fishing, and by impromptu I mean planned several days in advance--because gas don't grow on trees (yet)

So yea, if someone was responsible for funding something against the family, say something like I mention in this üîó[blog post](/Blog/daynight/2024/0524#chris-schammert "csmertx.com / Day & Night Blog / 2024 / 05-24 / Chris Schammert"), the one responsible would not be important to me (unless 'The One' was one of those Nestors in disguise as Schammerts). I could care less if that person has a billion dollars, million dollars, or hundreds of thousands of dollars. They're none of my concern. Let's put it this way, if I was walking around a big city and Donald Trump waved over at me for something I'd look right through him and keep going about my business. A lawyer I'd at least acknowledge. Nothing good would come from me interacting with a billionaire. Those that directly attack my family (digitally or physically) are very much my concern. I have no mercy for those types--regardless of their profession.

> I'm inclined to believe they did it through credit fraud to bank roll life insurance fraud. Very naughty indeed. Papers and IDs aren't cheap.

That reminds me, if any Schammert reading this has had problems with people attempting to take over accounts with the @XSchammert or XSchammert @ email.com format, üîó[these people](/Blog/daynight/2024/0524#chris-schammert "csmertx.com / Day & Night Blog / 2024 / 05-24 / Chris Schammert") are most likely responsible. One of them was fishing for my XSchammert @ protonmail.com for a while with an obvious e-bike scam/phishing operation. I wonder which one was responsible for that eh? They have a ton of free time, and could compete in regional social engineering contests, so they're probably saving a few thousand to try their hands at minor phishing campaigns. And I've exploited their egos a few times. It's not my fault they spent money needlessly. Avg. of $130K per life insurance fraud claim right? I bet going to that convention was pricey both mentally and financially huh? Oh well. Maybe save your supposition money eh? I could care less if that KubeCon/CloudNativeCon Nov. 12-15 Salt Lake City, Utah email was sent on my birthday. My birthday is just another day for me. I do like cake and ice cream though. A once a year celebration because I exist? Meh. For me that's like a participation trophy. After a certain age those are mostly just clutter anyway. Participation shirts are cool though. Well, I guess if it makes someone else happy it's ok. My personal opinion of my birthdays is mostly meh though. Before the age of 16 birthdays were the best. Awesome cakes. Maybe some friends over for basketball. Dude.

> We mostly played games of HORSE due to the ground being.. well.. ground instead of pavement. Also yellow cake üéÇü§™

Tell you h'what, if top tech YouTube creators knew about my story my social would be popping off right now. I have like 9 hours lifetime watch hours, and under 100 likes total. So uh, yea, I know what's up. There would be internal talk and sharing of my story. So no, I don't believe. What I do is this: I take in the content, take anything to do with me out of my mind, and enjoy. YouTubers are known for pushing smaller channels, and let me tell you something buddy, no one is pushing my account you know? Like I said, at least internal sharing. They're also not internally sharing this website. I'd know because people are often too lazy to enter a URL and use Google instead. No known searches for csmertx that lead to csmertx.com so far. Plus, if 10K people saw my website, there would be signs on my Github (website host). Even in the best case scenarios getting pushed by an upper tier creator amounts to ~10K subscribers. I mean, if the channel is amazing they would have had that within time anyway. My numbers are akin to someone such as myself that is both to busy to work the algorithm and without organic growth type talent. Which is fine by me.

> It was üîó[Occam's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor "Wikipedia.org / Occam's Razor") the whole time.

So, anytime there's a comment section (especially if money is involved like Super Chats, Patreon, etc.), instead of believing that the creators are speaking to me secretly, I remember that these people could be behind the scenes attempting to affect the conversation.

> Pacified people are less likely to be proactive. I uh, wanted to walk myself, stroll myself, and pacify myself as a child. GL

Anyway, that's it for now. Thank you for stopping by and my apologies for the longer post. I'm still being proactive, just working on some personal stuff first. Sorry to those that are afraid of blood. I forget some people are like that. Queasy and stuff for some reason. I'll never understand that phobia (üîó[Hemophobia](https://www.healthline.com/health/hemophobia "Healthline.com / Hemophobia")).

If anyone knows of an AI Wrangling job let me know. Crowd source AI Wrangling is nice and all, but it would be nice to have some steady work.
