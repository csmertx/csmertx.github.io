### Our Fraudsters are trying to frame both 'Turk', and the local landscapers.

Fraudsters using 'Turk's story about wanting to help with landscaping (too persistent, 3x visits) seem like a shake down propagated by the neighborhood landscapers to gain a client. My assumption is that they want to discredit a black owned business, and they want to punt their internship quality harassment on to someone else. And if I look racist and misogynistic in the process, well that's just icing on the sheet cake huh? A delicious victory to be savored by forked tongues. Pretty swanky new name for them huh? They're using what I think experienced people call 'runners' (like in the game [Shadowrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun_(1993_video_game) "Wikipedia.org / Shadowrun (1993 NES Video Game)"), only IRL). I don't know how many, but 'Turk' is one of them. He was employed to leave little trinkets around the yard after every visit. And if I'm not mistaken, runners don't ask questions. Fake shake downs have been working for them? Jesus Christ. That's just sad. Burnt piece of paper. A broken piece of fence on a drain trap. I have a fire extinguisher and a phone ready. Russian citizens would laugh at that shit. The neighbors are just noisy, and these folk think _THAT_ is my main source of my grief? Sure, it's troubling, but let's face it, I've lived in a room, in a trailer, that was next to one-way street away from a tavern. A fire station was across the street. I'm chillin' trying to find work. I'm going to keep collecting what makes sense to collect, and discard things that are irrelevant (like that burnt piece of paper and piece of fence). There are no Ogres in this neighborhood Mr. Chris/Max/Adam/That One Guy (I'll tag Mr. Chris on X with a link to this blog). Some people avoid drinking a bunch of liquids because sometimes when shot or tased, people piss their pants. That's crazy right? Pissing my pants would be the least of my worries. You can't punt your crimes away. You'll do time, while living off the taxpayer's dime. And I could care less what political party you're affiliated with. That's not my world. Believing that suffering helps is what they used against me. They used a book about the fucking Holocaust just to try to extract money from people. That's the kind of people they are. There's no undoing any of this. Just accept it. Much like I've accepted that I'll have no future.

> It's a very informative read, but very outdated - üîó [Man's Search for Meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man's_Search_for_Meaning). I believe the practice is known as immersion therapy. IIRC that book led to the advertisement revolution that took place shorty after WWII. I wouldn't be surprised if it was taught in business schools.

I've never fully accepted that someone will 'save me' from whatever it is people think I'd need to be saved from. The love I felt was a lie. So it goes. I'm doing really well in life outside of all this. Trying to maintain as always. Got my smile back, etc. Anyway, back to the serious stuff. There's no escaping this. And while it's true, this is 'just a blog post', these posts can be used in a court of law. Commit history is at the bottom of each page. I keep edits on my phone mostly, so that'll preserve metadata too if needed. I am very well spoken and considerate while in a court of law.

> I'm all alone, both mind and soul. I don't want your sympathy. And I'm doing the best I can with what I have. They can't exploit that weakness anymore. Like I said before, the voices lie. So it goes. Those voices will go away eventually.

Obviously not a funny one this time around. I'll take a psych evaluation at any time. No issues there. They'll have to fire off shells or heavy caliber to rattle me to my core. I mean, I've always had asthma deemed unfit for service, but still. To be fair, any doctor can hear the asthma in my voice. One of the reasons I'm so soft spoken. Make fun of it all you want. I just don't care about what you think. You're just a bunch of Fraudsters to me. You're not part of my family, you're not a friend, you're just a bunch of strangers that prey on the meek. Very un-Christian I might add. They own the type of ears that perk up when someone says they believe in ghosts. "Ah yea, it's fraudster time--is probably what they're thinking. It's time for y'all to suffer. Especially Adam. What a waist of potential. The video in which I'm folding my underwear is the last one you'll get from me directly. You'll aren't worth the effort or time of day to junk up my social media profiles.

Y'all will keep being idiots, because my words are merely words that 'should be silenced' right. This is not a movie. I want ya'll to know how to safely exist life as private citizens. I don't need to sex. I got that aspect covered. I'm a sinner in that regard, and I'm not afraid to admit it.

> I subscribe to the, "Be a man, use your hand" philosophy. Not much of a butt stuff dude.

Oh, and I thought I'd relay a phrase I've learned in the past few years. Not something I was exposed to, but something I've felt from time to time. üîó [parasocial-relationships](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parasocial-relationships). That word is the reason I've laughed in the Fraudster's face in a video I've uploaded. It essentially means a one sided relationship. That explains the type of relationship I experienced with Jennifer Nestor. After getting out of the hospital in 2009 (two day stay--more on that [here](/Blog/daynight/2022/)), I crash landed at a friend's house, and like a dumb ass I texted her. She relied with, "I'm hurt." So I called. And she didn't pick up the phone. That was the last thing she said to me. And she's just one of the Nestors involved in all of this. Where does it end? I have no idea. But that's not my responsibility. My responsibility is to remain calm, and like I said before: collect evidence that makes sense, and discard evidence that doesn't. Most of the money they've spent on trying to prevent me from exposing them has been wasted.

And listen, no one I want to see is going to be waiting for me as I adventure out. The only person that is knocking on the door is that dude 'Turk', whom has no idea what is going on. I opened that door with my breathing rate ready to defend the home. I was breathing like I'd just finished working out. When he said the word snake, I looked past him at the ground. No anger, no frustration, just full of that adrenaline I use to love to feel as a kid. Over the years I've learned to hone that feeling when I need it most. The Fraudsters (aka Nestors) actually helped with that. 'Turk' has no idea what's going on--he just wants to get paid. Apparently, the Nestors love to use people like that, while spreading lies about people like myself.

> Silver lining? I can breathe a lot better now. So I guess that's something.

I honestly thought they would back down, but apparently they're not very bright. Asking to be left alone is pointless, the Fraudsters (Nestors) don't know how to listen to things they don't want to hear. So I won't waste my time saying things like, "Oh no, don't leave little scraps of paper around the property." Losers. And like I said before, I've been stuck in this room since 2013, that's a long time to be by one's self huh?
