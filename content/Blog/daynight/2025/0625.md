So ah, for several years now I've avoided following people on the social medias. Mostly to stabilize and avoid awkward comments. Though these days I don't drink and am more financially stable, I still don't follow people. I think it's been working out real nice for everyone to be honest. Anyway, fun month ahead. These AI won't wrangle itself.

> Blueberries. Not Yoga balls. Acquiring paper is too important for me to cast off my mortal coil and become all non-corporal and stuff. Also, no thank you.

I know my Spider-man beanie makes me look like a walking mid-life crisis and I'm totally cool with that fact.

> Recently placed a wreath out for the new neighbors to look at. One of their friends came around asking if we've seen their lost wreath months ago, so I made one out of vines I stripped off the fence about a week ago. Better late than never right? Can't beat homemade either right? What's better than a homemade gift?

That wreath must have been worth a lot. To risk knocking on someone's door these days.. Anyway, I hope the neighbors enjoy the sight of this newly minted wreath. It's a beaut huh?

> Stay safe out there Florida. Especially South Florida (sheesh)

Yep, probably won't have much to write about this month. Seriously though, stay safe. The storm season NOAA 🔗 [forecast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNGtqwdXtpA "YouTube | CNN - National Hurricane Center warns this is the chance of an above-normal season") for the year looks like a 90% split between storm count stays the same as last year or storms will increase (60% above normal, 30% stays the same). I'm not banking on the 10% likelihood of fewer storms then last year.

> A friendly reminder to the Voices: la, la, la, I'm not listening, la, la, la, etc.

There. Those little vines were extra sticky too. Probably fried to a nice crispy brown color too. Nice.
