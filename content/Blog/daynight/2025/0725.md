By vacation I don't mean a vacation from work. I'll need help with that if I ever take a real vacation. Simply taking a step back from social media accounts and such. Few weeks, few months, what's the diff right? I've already accomplished a few goals I set for myself via social a while ago, so I should be set for a bit. Creative output quenched for a while too.

Anyway, I'm chilling out for a bit. Cya
