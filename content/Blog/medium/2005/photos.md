## Canon SLR

> I found an interesting camera on Ebay back in 2005 and played around with it for a few years. I'd like to point out that graffiti stencil stuff shown takes no sides--it was just an attempt to provoke thoughts. I was in my early twenties (selfies included).

### Printed via Me (2005-2007)

> Info on the printer & developer we used at the Millhopper CVS of Gainesville, FL: ðŸ”—[Bootlegged Banksy with a Noritsu](https://csmertx.github.io/Blog/daynight/2023/0823/#bootlegged-bansky-with-a-noritsu)

Always tryin' to find that angle

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/2.jpg "Black & White photo of a masonite or bakelite Budai statue")

B&W of a statue of whom is commonly known in U.S. America as The Laughing Buddha, but who was more accurately known as ðŸ”—[Budai](https://people.howstuffworks.com/that-fat-jolly-fella-isnt-buddha.htm "How Stuff Works | That Fat, Jolly Fella Isn't Buddha")

> Statue was lost at Morning Calm Apartments in 2009. Grandpa Schammert bought it while touring overseas (probably before I was born).

One of the few times I went on a journey to take pictures. Was with a cool dude who is no longer with us.

That one time I replaced my buddy's computer with a giant 65 LB cash register

> I removed it and re-installed his computer the same night, so it was all good lol

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/9.jpg "Pit lab mix scratching while sitting in the front room of an apartment. I'm in the back of the image, sitting at a computer. I'm only visible from the shoulders down")

From 2002 when my friends and I found the coolest dog (he went to an awesome loving household).

> Point and Shoot camera (ðŸ”—[high rez scan here](/Blog/medium/2005/scooby_high_school.png)). I'm the weirdo at the computer (my skateboard to my left)

> I installed the ceiling fan (with help) lol

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/10.jpg "Floor level angle of lots of beverage bottles placed artistically on an apartment kitchen floor")

Beverages bottles on the kitchen floor (I got a photo op of a dirty trick by a roommate).

> Dude carpeted my buddy's room floor with standing empty bottles, and I couldn't talk him out of it.

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/11.jpg "Photo shop mashup of a B&W iPod with wingdings displayed on the screen, and a cartoon eyeball install of the click wheel")

Used those fingerboard deck creating photoshop super skills to create a persona

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/12.jpg "Three vinyl records with multiple layers of spray paint. Two background layers, and shadowed stencils. One is a stencil of a man sitting on a toilet, with a line traced from his mouth to his heart. Another stencil is of a person surfing with bombs overhead and part of the wave cut away to show the text REALITY? (influenced by the 1979 movie Apocalypse Now) The final stencil is of an Star Wars universe All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST) with locs on the crown of its head and smoke coming out of the chin mounted blaster cannons")

Display, or DSPLY, or DP.

> The ðŸ”—[All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST)](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/All_Terrain_Scout_Transport "Star Wars Wiki | https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/All_Terrain_Scout_Transport") stencil was my very weird attempt to show my support for the legalization of Cannabis

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/12_1.jpg "1984 red Schwinn World Sport touring bike in a cluttered and scruffy looking dining room")

I got a little more use out of that back in 2010 thanks to a buddy.

> Seat was stolen by BMX riders while skating West Side Skatepark (skate sidewalk) in 2007. And later someone stole the entire bike from an apartment complex bike rack :'(

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/13.jpg "Xerox like image of an 80s era Macintosh computer with a black screen and white text that reads: BELIEVE EVERYTHING WE SAY DO EVERYTHING WE DO NO QUESTIONING...")

I thought the old boxy Macintosh computers worked well with the stencil text font

> Just cuz

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/16.jpg "Closeup of a vine holding on to a segment of a stick that was somehow preserved by the vine among the trees of a small wildlife sanctuary")

At 20-30 yards I thought the stick was floating, so I had a closer look and had a laugh

> You see it too right? That vine must have really wanted a dog

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/17.jpg "One of the Exit doors of the University of Florida (UF) backup and retrieval data center tape storage facility")

Backup data center of UF. That's the ... front door?

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/18.jpg "Rows of data storage tapes in the UF backup and retrieval data center tape storage facility")

Data center tapes!

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/19.jpg "Close up of in betwen a few of the storage tape shelving units of the UF backup and retrieval data center tape storage facility")

Better image of tapes!

> On the tile floor was the RCA Voice Recorder ([ðŸ”—RP-5010](https://www.amazon.com/RCA-RP5010-Digital-Voice-Recorder/dp/B00006LEJ9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8 "Amazon.com | Archived Listing | RCA RP5010 Digital Voice Recorder ")) I used to record all the Santa Fe Community College lectures I attended (a roommate worked at the backup facility, and thought the place was haunted (or perhaps he just didn't like me)--no audio evidence lol).

> A solid chunk of my 28 hours of study per week included listening to and taking notes using the college lecture recordings from the tiny RCA voice recorder device shown in image above

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/20.jpg "SLR bathroom mirror selfie of myself with a fresh haircut and wearing a sleeveless white shirt")

I've been cutting my own hair since 2001 lol. Senate wristband (I liked their backpacks and wheels), and the G-Shock I broke off my wrist during an aggressive inline picnic table session.

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/21.jpg "Another SLR bathroom selfie, this time with my hair sticking straight up, because it's that thick. I don't look amused by my antics")

Screamo band t-shirt? Check. Stoic selfie? Check. Nerd living in a scruffy spot? Check?

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/22.jpg "Same day as the previous SLR bathroom selfie, this time with my hair smoothed out flat. I seem slightly amused by my antics")

A few moments later (before I had the one front tooth extracted)

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/22_1.jpg "Selfie using an SLR camera in 2005")

That bathroom nearly always smelled of city pool chlorine .

> About to squish the lens with all that powa

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/22_2.jpg "Bathroom mirror selfie using an SLR camera in 2005")

Was that really a screamo band shirt? idk

> Water damage in the ceiling slightly visible above me 

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/23.jpg "Artistic photo of the pool partially blocked by a green sun umbrella from the angle of the second story handrail that ran the length of the apartment building we stayed in. I could have jumped from the handrail to inside the pool fence, if it wasn't such a drop. It was taken right outside our apartment door.")

A lot of parties took place around that pool back then.

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/23_1.jpg "Pool maintenance box next to public apartments pool")

Sidewalk looked close enough for a few drop tricks

> Frontside flip for $20. Any takers? lol

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/25.jpg "Photo of a sign placed in the water near the tourist access to Lake Alice of Gainesille, Florida near UF campus. The sign reads: DANGER ALLIGATORS, WILDLIFE SANCTUARY, NO FISHING, UNLAWFUL TO FEED ALLIGATORS. Over the years a few dogs have been eaten near that sign, because people think the lake is a joke (no waterway is too small for gators)")

Water line check at Lake Alice, Gainesville, Florida

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/26.jpg "Same photo of the dead mole mentioned earlier, but as a B&W glossy 5x7. Not sure if CVS even stocked matte 5x7 or 8x10 paper rolls")

5x7 B&W of a mole as I found it. There were a few stray cats in the area at the time.

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/26_1.jpg "Stray cat missing part of its right ear posing by a tree for a photo op")

Cat that prob killed the mole. I felt so bad about setting spring loaded mouse traps as a kid that I started developing my own contraptions lol

> tbh wasn't sure if bobcat until I developed the photos (digitized all to CDs)

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2005/27.jpg "Decently exposed B&W nighttime photo of a 7-8 foot tall roof top air conditioning condenser PVC drain pipe sticking out the side of a white cinder block Citgo gas station building of the corner of 13th and 16th Gville, FL.

I think this was my first attempt at the image above.

> No spray foam was harmed in the placement of that PVC pipe

<br />

I think this was my second attempt at this shot.
