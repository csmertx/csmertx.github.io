## Influenced by a documentary

Style Wars, which can be found üîó[here](https://archive.org/details/style-wars-1983-documentary-on-graffiti "Archive.org | Style Wars (1983 Documentary on Graffiti)")

> Staying in South Florida made me realize that my style was stagnant and childish

### Random doodles and sketches (2006-2007)

> I uh, nothing went up. Made a few stencils and had a few late nights, but nothing major

> Grew up listening to Beastie Boy songs thanks to my older brother. Hopefully some of that influence is apparent

<br />

DPAP?

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/2.jpg "A hungry looking purple monster slicking its hand and head out of a green trash can outlined with ink and filled in with paint pens")

If Oscar the Grouch and Grover were combined in a transporter accident and spent too much time in the badlands

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/3.jpg "Doodles around a large and slightly 3D iPath logo, all in black ink")

Apparently I really enjoyed iPath shoes

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/4.jpg "Illustrator ready outline of a black widow spider with a barcode instead of the typical red violin or hourglass associated with black widow spiders")

A trace of a trace of a trace of a trace

MC Sloth-A-Lot

> That shadow tho ... ?

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/6.jpg "Somewhat decent straight lettered piece with a jumbled mess of a background. Letters have a black front with white highlights 3D'd with firey orange and red")

Another attempt at DSPLY

> Had no concept of using the background to aid in camouflage

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/7.jpg "Blue and yellow interlocked 7z with a splash of bubbles as part of the shadow infill")

Gave up on DSPLY and took inspiration from üîó[12 oz. Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_oz._Mouse "Wiki | 12 oz. Mouse")

> Gave up on the background halfway through

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/8.jpg "Mildly disrespectful (rube) halo'd and interlocked 7z with black front highlighted silver with blue for the 3D and messed up bubbled black outline filled on the outside with silver (bubbles) and yellow for the main background infill")

Playing with backgrounds

> Made an honest background attempt. Felt like I was waisting paint pens

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/9.jpg "Illustrator ready TV with an axe in the side and blood oozing from the wound and pooling around the bottom of the TV. May have been a multi-layered stencil")

Shirt designs that never made the cut

<br />

Vampire squid? Yup.

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/11.jpg "Inked sketch style youth over a student desk that is also attached to the youth's hand. Behind him is a window, to symbolize Windows OS, youth looks sleepy dreaming about a clock as a giant hand drops a book to wake up the student")

Community college made me tired

> One of our local substitute teachers would drop a book next to sleeping students

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/12.jpg "A few Illustrator ready inked lines connecting a side mirror, rear view mirror, and a circle for negative space in the place where a steering wheel would be for a typical sized human")

I drove a lot back then

> Maybe an hour a day, and always with a caffeine pill in my stomach

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/13.jpg "Illustrator reading inked long necked punk rock looking guy squatting slightly with a snake like neck nearly touching the same plane as its feet")

Lonnnng neck

> Tattoo? idk

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/14.jpg "Inked and illustrator reading milk jug made of glass with a cork stopper and a cartoon skull on a rounded diamond shaped label to illicit thoughts of poison")

Wasn't drinking as much from 22 onwards

> Seemed like 21 was a year long Octoberfest tbh

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/15.jpg "Inked and illustrator ready Pez dispenser with a blank face and dispensing unlabeled candy")

Another failed t-shirt design

> I got wrecked in the Threadless commits for this design submission

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/16.jpg "A distinctive gentleman wearing stereotypical clothing of a (chemistry?) professor with his head turned sideways. His mouth is open in what may have been a burp or mid sneeze")

My character from when I was in 2nd grade. I called him Professor Perfect.

> Sup with that backwards shadow? idk

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/18.jpg "Graffiti scribbles")

Playing with throw-ups

> Quick and simple graffiti pieces

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/19.jpg "A very flat attempt at 3D straight lettered graffiti in black, white, and blue")

DSPLE (pronounced display)

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/20.jpg "No attempt at 3D, with straight lettered graffiti in black and white")

Meh

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/21.jpg "A very flat attempt at 3D straight lettered graffiti in yellow, red, black, and orange, with nuclear power plant containment stacks")

DSPLE

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/22.jpg "Inked angel speaking bomb language (bomb-bomb style) wearing headphones, and with a tilted halo")

Failed t-shirt design based on the tribal inspired doodles I enjoyed scribbling in high school

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/23.jpg "Sloppy black front with yellow and white edge highlighting, orange and red stacked 3D, and kind of looks like the lettering is resting on a deep blue iceberg. There's a question mark popping out of the letter. It was day one of writing")

Hot and cold, like volcanic rock floating on an iceberg or something


<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/24.jpg "Inked giant floating head in front of platforms, kind of like a video game boss monster, but more like a drawing one would expect from one of H. R. Giger's children--if he had had children")

I'm sure there's a psychological reason for this one.. idk lol


<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/25.jpg "Penciled side profile of a tribal inspired goblin head with hydraulic lines attached to the back of its head")

I think I dreamt of a goblin/sandman inspired mecha


<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/26.jpg "Five inked scribbles of the word ghost on the left, and orange and blue paint pen flow tests on the right")

Some of my first graffiti doddles. I think at first I tried Sharky, and disliked the outcome so much that I ended up burning the paper to cook some hotdogs outside my motel in Margate, Florida.

> This cookout took place in the same timeline in which I marbled my car with spray paint (CMYK?). It would have looked decent had I finished with a clear coat tbh. My once teal Honda 3D was a little wild without the clear coat.

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/27.jpg "Inked gimch.org letters on a B&W 3D platform that sort of resembles the bean like shape of mitochondria")

Logo for one of several failed website ideas

> Acronym would have been: Go Into My Cardboard House

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/28.jpg "Penciled graph paper outline of a very angular sewer complex map from the top down")

Made an attempt to design a sewer system Quake 1 level. This one may have been from 2011 tbh.

> I probably would have completed it had I had the foresight to research large scale waste treatment facilities

<br />

![albumimg](/Blog/medium/2006/quake_1_player_model_elmo_square.png "Quake 1 green armored player model skin with Elmo's face and red arms")

Close approximation of a Quake 1 clan skin I made in 1999

> Elmo's Reign! NetZero dial-up! üîó[Ad marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetZero "Wikipedia | NetZero") guinea pig! Wait..
