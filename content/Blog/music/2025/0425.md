> Laugh if you want, but that person fights their own battles. They the one that goes out for milk you know?

> buh, instead of milk, it's potatoes to feed they mealworms you know? They are no prince alright?

> There's a pretty decent mealworm joint a few sectors over. But the parking sucks yeah?

> And Yes. I know that there are villages that raise mealworms for food IRL.

> Mealworms are exceptionally dense sources of clean protein.

> I'd eat a mealworm burger if I didn't have to pay for it.

> Mash them mealworms up. Make whatever.

> Maybe dip for your sweet potato chips.

> Raise the worms in concrete bins.

> Just stir a few times a day.

> It's all good 😋🤘

> So it goes eh?

> And yea, I did.

> I raised worms bruh.

> And it taught me things.

> Well, mostly about icky stuff.

> Always replenish with fresh worms.

> Because if not you'll have tiny worms dude.

> And to be fair, in this instance tiny is not ideal at all 🚫.

> Also, there are super long mealworms available for feeding reptiles.

> I know this because it's the super long mealworms that I tried so hard to raise.

> Well, this was like two decades ago you know? Are there still super longs? 🪓in' for a friend..

> Anyway, and within six months my mealworms went from super long down to super short mealworms.

> I incidentally foreshortened my supply of mealworms. They outlived my toads too. My beautiful toads 😭😭.
