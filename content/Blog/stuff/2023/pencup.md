One of my guilty pleasure hobbies is skateboarding with my fingers. I was never average at skateboarding and Florida has a lot of summer rain. Anyway, I wanted my desk to look nicer, and so I made this thing. Used silver Testors model paint for the sign.

I don't go out to eat and I rarely drink alcohol, so there's always a little money rolling around for these little projects.
