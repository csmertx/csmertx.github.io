> RPi4 == Raspberry Pi 4

I wanted a tiny console to check out ARM architecture stuff. My notes are at: Linux > Devices > RPi4

This one does not include a parts list because this configuration killed the official RPi4 LCD screen. I sold my RPi4 because of sketchy hats (addon boards). Next attempt will be something different (if there is another attempt).
