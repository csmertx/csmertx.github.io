**Aftercore**

"The Sea is a tough thing for someone with only a couple of skills. Better to wait a bit on that.

I'd suggest: go to the Mall and buy a Training Scroll: Snokebomb and read it. You'll have to use your karma from this run to perm it for use in future runs, but it is an excellent skill to have for turncutting. If you can't afford the 185k meat for one, spend a couple of days farming the Knob Treasury or pygmy orderlies.

Other things to do in aftercore (without needing content unlockers): Kill your nemesis. Rescue Subject #37 in the Knob Laboratories. Get a towel from the Haunted Bathroom. Get a silver shrimp fork. Do the quest associated with your moon sign (Chomsky's comic books, Marty's quest, or Mayor Zapruder's quest). Get a facsimilie dictionary from the Valley of Roflmao. Do the White Citadel quest from your guild. Do the Dawrven Factory Complex puzzle. Do Fernswarthy's tower quest. Do the quests for the Meatsmith, the Armorer, and Doc Galactik. Do Lady Spookyraven's quest on the 3d floor. Do the two Spookyraven Lights Out quests. Defend the Gourd."
