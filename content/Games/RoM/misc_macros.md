# 'F2P' MMORPG game similar to World of Warcraft

> I enjoy gaming the game ^_ __+

## Andor Training Mini Game

1. Create a new macro and add the following two lines

    ```/script UseExtraAction(1)```

    ```/script SpellTargetUnit("mouseover")```

2. Drag the macro to an action bar and map it to a key like ```F3```

    > Do it. Do it for ðŸ”— [Taborea](https://runesofmagic.fandom.com/wiki/Taborea "Fandom | Runes of Magic - Taborea").

## Advanced Auction House tooltip

> Mouse hover on certain items displays recent AH prices for that item

- ```/ahh history```

- Log out + login to save changes

## Steam launched Client.exe crashes at login of every character

> Fortunately Steam can self repair corrupted game files with a few clicks.

- Steam App > Library > RMB Runes of Magic > Properties > Installed Files

    - RMB ```Verify integrity of game files```

    - Wait for Gameforge server to sync with local files

    - Try to login (should be fine)
