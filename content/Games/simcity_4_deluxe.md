## Steam Launch Options (Windowed 4K)

- ```-intro:off -CustomResolution:enabled -r3840x2160x32 -CPUCount:1 -CPUPriority:high -Cursors:fullcolor```

For my use it was easier to use an additional display for üîó [Jellyfin](/Linux/Software/jellyfin "CSx | Linux | Software | Jellyfin") rather than split-screen. Not sure if there is a UI scaling either. YMMV
