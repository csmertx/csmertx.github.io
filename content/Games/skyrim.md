## Nvidia P620 + Linux Mint 21.3

- Lost access to The Elder Scrolls IV (Oblivion) and V (Skyrim) on September 20th, 2023

    - Possibly due to this üîó [bug](https://www.protondb.com/app/22330#sL_KcHMBYi "ProtonDB.com | Game Details for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion GOTYE \ After getting the game to actually launch, it plays perfectly with very few issues. Mod managers however mostly have no Linux support.").

        - My P620 is a business class card like their NVIDIA RTX A4500
    
    - No issues with XFX Radeon RX 6400 as of a few weeks ago
