## Pinetime Smartwatch?

~$40 smartwatch with Open Source firmware. And more reliable than any other Android smartwatch in that price range. Mine was shipped and on my wrist within a month (03/23/22 - 04/06/22).

## Reporting in after close to a year

1. Raising wrist to wake up the device is mostly awesome

    > Sometimes waking device displays last notification (swipe to clear notification)

    >  Sometimes waking device displays a random game of pong

2. Vibration is neat to have, but is kind of weak and there's no option to change the vibe pattern

    > Vibe double pulse option for notifications would be helpful

    > Vibe pattern options may be helpful for waking up to alarms

3. Maybe a build without games?

    > Sometimes I find that the watch is playing Pong instead of letting my check the time

4. Touch screen glass held up to a lot of 'abuse'

    > Dismantling a deck, skateboarding, and hitting it on to the corners of door frames and walls.

5. Timer sometimes pauses without a finger tap

6. Holds up fine in the shower, but water drops play havoc on touch screen (expected)

7. Replaced my Casio F91-w

8. Random 'ghost' touches (long arm hairs? finger oil residue? idk)
