## Waveshare WM8960 Soundcard

- Unable to access the capabilities of this RPi4 hat

## Issues

- KDE login with touchscreen maybe wasn't tested as much for RPi4 as other ARM devices.

## More details

I wish I could provide more details. Unfortunately, I failed to properly document this experiment.
