### Raspberry Pi 4 (2021)

#### Waveshare WM8960 Soundcard
- ?

#### Rebooting
- Unlike with Ubuntu 20.04, I was unable to successfully reboot the system.

#### Why the long face?
- It's not Manjaro's fault, KDE Plasma's onscreen (virtual) keyboard w/official 7in Pi display was (2021--will revisit soon-ish) a separate hobby project.
- To be fair, it's a task to get fingerprint reader working in SDDM (KDE Plasma display manager) via a 2019 Thinkpad.
- Since I fried my touchscreen using an off the shelf RPi power management solution, I can't retest until I get a new display.

#### I'll be back.
- An open source RPi NAS/media player industrial design project is coming to life in my Nextloud docs.
