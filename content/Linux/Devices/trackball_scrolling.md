Elecom HUGE button remapping via GUI: üîó[input-remapper](https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper)

> Requires escalated privileges

Restore presets for each reboot/poweroff

- ```sudo systemctl enable input-remapper```

- ```sudo systemctl start input-remapper```

- Apply presets & make sure ```Autoload``` is toggled

#### Copy/Paste with Tmux, Refresh, and Undo (how I have mine configured)

- FN1 -> Shift + Ctrl + v

- FN2 -> F5

- FN3 -> Ctrl + z
