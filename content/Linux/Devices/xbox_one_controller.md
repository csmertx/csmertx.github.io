## Disable Mouse Emulation

- ```vim /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-joystick.conf```

    ```
    Driver "joystick"
    ++ Option "StartKeysEnabled" "False"   # These Two Lines Disable
    ++ Option "StartMouseEnabled" "False"  # The mouse emulation
    EndSection
    ```

## LTrigger/RTrigger Issue

- ```apti joystick```

- ```apti jstest-gtk```

- Open ```joystick``` and calibrate (swap Axis 2 with 4 to correct)
