## Trouble with remapped keyboard layout (xmodmap, etc.)

- Edit Profile > Keyboard > Linux Console

  - To switch back remember: XFree 4

  - Fix for Yakuake too since it pulls in the same profile(s) as Konsole

- Other keybindings might be affected by this "fix" (```F4```, etc.)

  - So long [xmodmap](/Linux/Assorted/xmodmap), hello [custom keyboard PCB](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint)?
