## Using Mutt the safe way

> Encrypt plain text password file for added security

- ```gpg --gen-key```

- ```mkdir ~/.mutt```

- ```touch ~/.mutt/password```

- ```vim ~/.mutt/password```

    ```
    ++ mysecretpassword
    ```

- ```gpg -r myemail@email.com -e ~/.mutt/password```

    > Encrypts sensitive data

- edit out sensitive information

    > Check for original ```~/.mutt/password``` (without .gpg)

    - ```shred ~/.mutt/password```

        > If the original file remains--it's been a few years since I've used Mutt

- ```vim ~/.muttrc```

    ```
    ++ source "gpg -d ~/.mutt/password.gpg |" 
    ```
