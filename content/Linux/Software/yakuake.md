#### Trouble with remapped keyboard layout (xmodmap, etc.)
- Edit Profile > Keyboard > Linux Console
- To switch back remember: XFree 4
- Fix for Konsole too since it pulls in the same profile(s) as Yakuake
- Other keybindings might be affected by this "fix" (F4, etc.)
  - So long xmodmap, hello custom keyboard PCB
