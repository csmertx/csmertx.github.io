> Drop-down terminal emulator for KDE

## Installation

- ```apti yakuake```

## Trouble with remapped keyboard layout (xmodmap, etc.)

- Edit Profile > Keyboard > Linux Console

- To switch back remember: XFree 4

  > I hope someone knows what I was talking about here (can't recall)

- Fix for Konsole too since it pulls in the same profile(s) as Yakuake

  > Same user profiles used for Konsole and Yakuake

- Other keybindings might be affected by this "fix" (F4, etc.)

  > So long xmodmap, hello custom keyboard PCB?

## Resources
