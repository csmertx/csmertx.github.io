- 2 tbsp. nutritional yeast

- 2 tsp. smoked paprika

- 2 tsp. onion powder

    > Or 3 tsp. Complete Seasoning)

- 1 tsp. garlic powder

- 1 tsp. coriander

- 1 tsp. italian seasoning

- ¬æ cup vegetable broth

    > Or 1/2 tsp. seasoning + 3/4 cup water + 1 tsp. olive oil

- 2 tbsp. tahini

    > Or smooth peanut butter

- 2 tbsp. tomato past 

    > Or 1.5 tsp. ketchup & 1 tsp. sambal & 1 tsp. brown sugar

- 1 tbsp. soy sauce

- 1 tsp. liquid smoke

    > Or 1 tsp. smoked paprika

- BBQ sauce of choice

## DIRECTIONS:

1. Grease an 8√ó8 baking pan and preheat the oven to 350 F. In a large bowl, mix the vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder and coriander. In a separate bowl, mix the broth, tahini, tomato paste, soy sauce and liquid smoke.

2. In the bowl with the dry ingredients, make a small moat in the middle and then pour the wet ingredients into the dry bowl. Mix the ingredients quickly (you‚Äôll see that the mixture thickens within seconds, so be ready to mix it fast). Knead the ‚Äúdough‚Äù for about a minute. Normally for seitan recipes you knead for up to five minutes, but to keep this as ‚Äútender‚Äù as possible, only knead for a minute or so.

3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Flatten the mix out onto the baking pan so that it reaches the edges and then cut into rib strips as thick or thin as you like. Because the dough is a little clingy, it actually works best to cut these strips with a pizza cutter. Bake for 25 minutes then remove from the oven and coat the top generously with barbeque sauce. Flip it, coat the other side, and then put back in the oven for another 15 minutes. (Air Fry @ 350F for 7.5min both sides (15min total) try 5x5 first)

4. Remove, let cool and then chow down while watching some Carlos Rib(s)iero footage!
