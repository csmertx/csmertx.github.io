## Google Search Console verification (URL prefix) and Github Pages

- First step is to visit: https://search.google.com/search-console?action=inspect

- Add downloaded ```googleXXXX.html``` to ```/static```

- Wait 3-5 minutes for Github Pages to update the site before clicking verify

- Add website sitemap via: https://search.google.com/search-console/sitemaps
    
    > Hugo via Github Pages: https://user.github.io/sitemap.xml

- All that's left to do is wait in line for the site to be indexed
