## Google Search Console verification (URL prefix) and Github Pages

> 🔗[Namecheap Advanced DNS instructions](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9252/2208/how-do-i-add-my-domain-to-google-sites/ "Namecheap.com | How do I add my domain to Google Sites")

- First step is to visit: 🔗 https://search.google.com/search-console?action=inspect

- Add downloaded ```googleXXXX.html``` to ```/static```

- Wait 3-5 minutes for Github Pages to update the site before clicking verify

- Add website sitemap via: 🔗 https://search.google.com/search-console/sitemaps
    
    > Hugo via Github Pages: ...user.github.io/sitemap.xml

- All that's left to do is wait in line for the site to be indexed

## Robots.txt blocking Google crawl

> [🔗 Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) > Indexing > Pages > Why pages aren’t indexed

> For me it was this URL: ...user.github.io/tags/

- ```vim ../config.toml```

    - Change ```enableRobotsTXT = true``` to ```enableRobotsTXT = false```

- Upload the following robots.txt to ```/static/robots.txt```

    ```
    User-agent: *
    Disallow:
    ```
