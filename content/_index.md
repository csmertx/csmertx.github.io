@chris.schammert on Facebook is part of a family hitchhiking on our family name.

They might be from the Nestor family (image below) of Broward/Palm Beach Counties. IIRC the Nestor family name originated from Scotland.

Read more about that if you want here: 🔗 [Day & Night Blog \ Chris Schammert](/Blog/daynight/2024/0524#chris-schammert "Day & Night Blog \ May 2024"), and here: 🔗 [Day & Night Blog \ Wrapping Up](/Blog/daynight/2024/0724#wrapping-up "Day & Night Blog \ July 2024").

![Photo](/KCNA24_Keynotes_stock_image_raymond_yuan_jennifer_nestor.png "Jennifer Nestor and Raymond Yuan (?) posing for stock conference photo")

> Jennifer Nestor and possibly Raymond Yuan (Chinese American--his family owned a Chinese restaurant in Palm Beach County). She specialized in human resources while working for the local movie theater chain of Palm Beach County before going into karaoke hosting.

> After mimicking her roommate (blanking on her roommate's name, but she taught Nestor how to host karaoke events and incidentally act like a skater girl. She also dated a guy named Rufus) she talked me into living in South Florida (Spring of 2008). While we were still dating (and her persona faded), she dated Yuan (he used my razor--she bragged about that) as I worked 90 hour weeks at Pompano Park via United Tote vendor. Operator by day and technician by night.

> Yuan favors glocks, possibly hollow points (more stopping power, less likely to pierce threw walls), and probably has it concealed. He plays games like Oblivion, but he consistently appeared inpatient while attempting to extract information.

> Nestor's new 'friend' is most likely someone from Boston (hence the Boston Red Sox earrings). Her telltale sign is when she occasional drops her persona or momentarily acquired accent. Ask her about her family's chicken and rice jingle. She may still have a large satellite group from Broward County that she conferences with for brain storming. Her hand flapping may be a technique used to seem less threatening for when her Scottish temper flairs. She also has a passion for spreading rumours or lying to her 'friends' which she uses to get responses, blackmail, extort, and exploit others kindness. In The Apprentice days (2008) of South Florida she would toss trash out of her vehicle while driving. They'll also hire people with impressive sound systems, limos, etc. for intimidation.

> They have created at least six fake names: Chris J. (not me), Adam (not my cousin), Max (not my cousin), Kc (not my brother), Jackie (not my sister), and Ronald Schammert. Novak may also be a last name of interest. Knowing jackals have infiltrated my family with their military draft dodging tendencies is something I'll die for to correct. They'll create more if they get an inroad into the Linux world. The houses those individuals have were purchased with money that does not belong to them.

> Christopher J. Schammert (not me, 🔗 [this guy](https://facebook.com/chris.schammert)), and Max (not my cousin) had children. Which is very unfortunate for the children. If they hadn't placed me through two years of hell I may have been able to take pity. You've help mold the person I am today. My trust is now earned through varies levels of tests. Schammerts are not lazy people. That's a difficult test for these people to pass.

> I wouldn't doubt that they bought the house across the street. It was part of an attempted murder investigation (local TV news was on this street). They also spent a lot of time remodeling (basically gutted), so it was probably really affordable. Lots of little signs too. What neighbor would actually care enough to say something about an orange King Ghidorah shirt? They're the ONLY neighbors that have spoken to me directly since I moved in back in 2013. She said it in such a snide tone too. I scan while I'm everywhere, much like baby proofing and keeping a house baby proofed. My family does the same. If a neighbor comes up to me,while I'm out I'll be curt but polite. My mannerism will scream, "I'm busy. Leave me alone."

> I believe the 🔗 [letter](/Blog/daynight/2024/0724#wrapping-up "Day & Night Blog \ July 2024") I sent to FBI HQ through USPS was intercepted. I'll keep trying. Multiple copies. Multiple offices. Multiple mail companies. Agents will know one way or another. If I or any of my family die, the investigation will lead here. I'd think twice before hiring someone to create 'an unfortunate traffic accident'.

> Her uncle has used at least one his properties (1 to 2 room flat) to host at least some of those brainstorming meetings. Also a wannabe enforcer/pusher dude by the name of Tommy (big ears, pale skin, creepy stare, probably a Nestor or Novak, likes the company of people afraid of him, preferred vehicles that make him look 'gangster').

> Tommy was sitting on the couch of that 'drug den' house. He was also present when I went to the Deerfield Beach, FL Subway for a tuna sub. I remember this because Jennifer Nestor answered the phone while we were chilling in 'our' room, seemed irate (screamed into the phone like a jackal), and I thought maybe she needed a bite to eat. She was most likely on the phone with Tommy. This was another underhanded intimidation tactic. He said nothing to me at that Subway sandwich shop, nor did he lock eyes with me for long. She didn't want half of my tuna sub.

> The twin sized mattress I found still in a bag next to the dumpster at The Preserve at Deer Creek Apartments was probably an extra from the mattresses they used to stage that 'drug den' house. Same period of time (late spring early summer 2009) in which a limo appeared to drop stuff off. They had the password to enter that gated community.

> I dropped Jennifer Nestor off at Florida Atlantic University, and she probably got a ride to that house (Oakland Park?) to brainstorm new tactics. I should have known something was up when she never had 'homework'. Everyone studies. Midterms, finals, etc.. She randomly stopped going to class. And no white collared property owner (her uncle) would look as composed as her uncle did inside a 'drug den' (Palm Beach County / Broward County). Unless he was surrounded by accomplices. IIRC his personal home is close to A1A. They also exploit weaknesses in others (in private) like love (me), drinking, hard drugs, sex, and are not afraid to extort and exploit if the opportunity is present. Everyone in that room looked like they were waiting for a meeting to start. One woman was sitting at a small breakfast type dining table (one chair) near the front entrance doing nothing at all. No texting, no solitaire, just observing.

<!--c This website comprises a patchwork of notes written over my 10+ years with Linux (+2 served apps). I also poked at DOS prompts as a youth (1988) before my high school typing and web design classes (1999-2001). Due to the rolling nature of open source and or free software, the notes may not align with the current timeline of the subject's software documentation. I mostly focus my efforts on edge cases as I find them. On top of that I have included a life story blog, and a music blog, which may appeal to a broader audience. The warning above is mostly for music lyrics, some life stories, and my occasional use of profanity. I was raised on a mixture of English dialects via family brought together by the U.S. Navy--hopefully my attempt at college English will improve with time. I accept pull requests and emails. No worries about time of day or night. I capitalize on Don't Disturb Modes, so anytime is a good time. My use of an Orca illustration is merely for entertainment purposes. The depiction of an Orca is not meant as a personal attack towards anyone, nor is it a prelude into a new Linux OS. Glory to the maintainers! And thank you for checking the source! -->
