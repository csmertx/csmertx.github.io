## This is my [ CRS ](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=CRS "Urbandictionary.com / CRS (Can't Remember Shit)") site. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Some of the pages for example 🔗 [NetBSD](/Unix/NetBSD/netbsd) are a snapshot of my observations from 2018. Please refer to project documentation before wantonly copying and pasting from this website. Sources cited at the bottom of each page. Thank you.
