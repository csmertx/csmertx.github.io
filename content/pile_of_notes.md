## The beauty and curse of Linux

While nature of open source and Linux means fewer bureaucratic hoops to jump through to make changes, sometimes changes are introduced that break compatibility with older documentation. [source code for this website](https://github.com/csmertx/csmertx.github.io/tree/main/content).

## Mission

This site is more focused on niche solutions to niche problems, and experiencing GNU/Linux.

> Or: maybe this website is all about the journey, and not about the destination? ;)

## Have a good one

And I hope it's a good one too
