## The beauty and curse of Linux

While developers of open source and Linux have fewer corporate hoops to jump through to make changes, there are times when changes break compatibility with older documentation (like these notes). So ah, watch out for that. Here is the [source code for this website](https://github.com/csmertx/csmertx.github.io/tree/main/content).

## Navigation

Tap the top left hamburger. Also, the top right arrow hides the button to change the website theme, and the Github repo of this website. At the bottom of each page is a ^Top link that scrolls the page back to the top of the website.
