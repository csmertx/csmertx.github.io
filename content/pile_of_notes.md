## The beauty and curse of Linux

While developers of open source and Linux have fewer corporate hoops to jump through to make changes, there are times when changes break compatibility with older documentation (like these notes). So ah, watch out for that.

## Data warning

If you have limited cell data, steer clear of the Day & Night blog. That's where I hide all my custom animated gifs.

## Navigation

Tap the top left hamburger. Also, the top right arrow hides the button to change the website theme, and the link to the Github repo of this website. At the bottom of each page is a ^Top link that scrolls the page back to the top of the page. There's also a search feature for returning visitors.
