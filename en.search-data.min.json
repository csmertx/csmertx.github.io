And more reliable than any other Android smartwatch in that price range. Mine was shipped and on my wrist within a month (03/23/22 - 04/06/22).\nReporting in after close to a year Raising wrist to wake up the device is mostly awesome\nSometimes waking device displays last notification (swipe to clear notification)\nSometimes waking device displays a random game of pong\nVibration is neat to have, but is kind of weak and there\u0026rsquo;s no option to change the vibe pattern\nVibe double pulse option for notifications would be helpful\nVibe pattern options may be helpful for waking up to alarms\nMaybe a build without games?\nSometimes I find that the watch is playing Pong instead of letting my check the time\nTouch screen glass held up to a lot of \u0026lsquo;abuse\u0026rsquo;\nDismantling a deck, skateboarding, and hitting it on to the corners of door frames and walls.\nTimer sometimes pauses without a finger tap\nHolds up fine in the shower, but water drops play havoc on touch screen (expected)\nReplaced my Casio F91-w\nRandom \u0026lsquo;ghost\u0026rsquo; touches (long arm hairs? finger oil residue? idk)\nUpgrading via Android phone Check resources below for Gadetbridge.\nUpgrade firmware to 1.11.x via computer (external

Medium","content":"\nInfluenced by a documentary Style Wars, which can be found üîóhere\nStaying in South Florida made me realize that my style was stagnant and childish\nRandom doodles and sketches (2006-2007) I uh, nothing went up. Made a few stencils and had a few late nights, but nothing major\nGrew up listening to Beastie Boy songs thanks to my older brother. Hopefully some of that influence is apparent\nDPAP?\nIf Oscar the Grouch and Grover were combined in a transporter accident and spent too much time in the badlands\nApparently I really enjoyed iPath shoes\nA trace of a trace of a trace of a trace\nMC Sloth-A-Lot\nThat shadow tho \u0026hellip; ?\nAnother attempt at DSPLY\nHad no concept of using the background to aid in camouflage\nGave up on DSPLY and took inspiration from üîó12 oz. Mouse\nGave up on the background halfway through\nPlaying with backgrounds\nMade an honest background attempt. Felt like I was waisting paint pens\nShirt designs that never made the cut\nVampire squid? Yup.\nCommunity college made me tired\nOne of our local substitute teachers would drop a book next to sleeping students\nI drove a lot back then\nMaybe an hour a day, and always with a caffeine pill in my stomach\nLonnnng neck\nTattoo? idk\nWasn\u0026rsquo;t drinking as much from 22 onwards\nSeemed like 21 was a year long Octoberfest tbh\nAnother failed t-shirt design\nI got wrecked in the Threadless commits for this design submission\nMy character from when I was in 2nd grade. I called him Professor Perfect.\nSup with that backwards shadow? idk\nPlaying with throw-ups\nQuick and simple graffiti pieces\nDSPLE (pronounced display)\nMeh\nDSPLE\nFailed t-shirt design based on the tribal inspired doodles I enjoyed scribbling in high school\nHot and cold, like volcanic rock floating on an iceberg or something\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s a psychological reason for this one.. idk lol\nI think I dreamt of a goblin/sandman inspired mecha\nSome of my first graffiti doddles. I think at first I tried Sharky, and disliked the outcome so much that I ended up burning the paper to cook some hotdogs outside my motel in Margate, Florida.\nThis cookout took place in the same timeline in which I marbled my car with spray paint (CMYK?). It would have looked decent had I finished with a clear coat tbh. My once teal Honda 3D was a little wild without the clear coat.\nLogo for one of several failed website ideas\nAcronym would have been: Go Into My Cardboard House\nMade an attempt to design a sewer system Quake 1 level. This one may have been from 2011 tbh.\nI probably would have completed it had I had the foresight to research large scale waste treatment facilities\nClose approximation of a Quake 1 clan skin I made in 1999\nElmo\u0026rsquo;s Reign!

If so, then this website layout may change again in the future. Super stoked how the collapsible menus look. That was my reasoning behind picking the üîó Geekdocs theme. Also added a spot to share random music hosted on YouTube. As I update my CD collection I\u0026rsquo;ll share more songs. CDs are so much easier to deal with compared to vinyl\u0026ndash;I can\u0026rsquo;t tell the difference between .mp3 and .flac formats anyway. This lil blog is also a way for me to keep my social media accounts and post elsewhere. Wait out the ad-pocalpyse over in this little corner of cyberspace and whatnot.\nJanuary 13, 2023 Legacy WinXP devices via modern PCs A few years ago I built a persistent Arch Linux system to run off a USB drive. I needed a way to connect a VCR2DVD device with drivers only for Windows XP to a modern computer. Why not Windows XP from a USB drive? It boots to Linux, and loads a virtualized copy of Windows XP with physical access to modern USB ports. And now it\u0026rsquo;s time to build the system again (it\u0026rsquo;s not for me). Why not build it and talk about it when it\u0026rsquo;s finished? Extra motivation to document the process and finish it in the next week or two I guess?\nJanuary 16, 2023 Less personal posts, and more technical posts Hwhat?\nBooting Arch Linux off a USB drive with a specific laptop is not going all that well. It\u0026rsquo;s funny how much things change in only a few years. If only I knew what I did two years ago to make it all work. WinXP legacy devices.. Tried Debian stable earlier, and now trying Ubuntu 22.04 Server. If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work I\u0026rsquo;ll look at other options. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep the too much information (TMI) blog posts up, because there\u0026rsquo;s no one to spray me with a garden hose.\nJanuary 17, 2023 Spelling and Grammar I guess it all depends on your perspective. I know I can do better, and I\u0026rsquo;ll try my darndedest. I really want ArchXP to be a thing. How cool would that be? Not cool at all but still. Arch Linux, USB drive, sometime in the next year. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\nFishing and PFAS üîó Eating one wild fish same as month of drinking [PFAS] tainted water: study\nüîó U.S. Fish \u0026amp; Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuges System: ECDMS4Wildlife \u0026amp; Environmental Contaminants Mapper\nThis is why we can\u0026rsquo;t have nice wild caught fish for dinner.\nJanuary 18, 2023 Music Blog Posts Just for fun. Most are from my own collection, and addressing the Samurai Champloo Music Record entry: I just like the music. When I first watched the Samurai Champloo series, I was buying vinyl records from the Definitive Jux record label. Nujabes fit the style of music I was diving in to at the time and really encouraged me in to become a fan of the anime.\nJanuary 19, 2023 Github-Pages Test Added a new bug report for the markdown formatting mess. I also configured Visual Studio Code with Github markdown extension. It\u0026rsquo;ll be a little bit, but I doubt that more than 13 people visit this site, so in theory few will be affected as I break the website in the process. I\u0026rsquo;m just guessing, I have no accurate way to tell who is viewing what on the website. Consistent cloning though, so that\u0026rsquo;s cool.\nGithub-Pages Success I updated the Music Blog with a song from an American band I\u0026rsquo;ve appreciated since the early 00s, and deployment (converting markdown to HTML) failed. Deployments continued to fail until I removed the name of a certain country that just happens to be part of the band name. Post rock? I like guitar sounds. Which reminds me: üîó YouTube | Ronald Jenkees - Guitar Sound. I guess github-pages also scrapes and analyzes website link titles, because it kept failing until I removed the YouTube link to the song (Death Rides a Horse). I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a fan of the \u0026lsquo;underdogs\u0026rsquo;, so I hope it\u0026rsquo;s clear that I do not support what\u0026rsquo;s happening\u0026ndash;I just didn\u0026rsquo;t expect github-pages to be so selective.\nJanuary 20, 2023 IRL Designs blog Everything is a blog or Vlog these days c\u0026rsquo;mon. I made some stuff in the past two years, so I thought why not include them as well right? Two can be printed (STLs included), one can be casted, and the other can be purchased. RPi4 Console parts list not included because the configuration zapped my official 7in RPi LCD screen. So it goes. The Day \u0026amp; Night title of this blog subsection has little to do with the lyrics of the Kid Cudi song Day \u0026lsquo;N\u0026rsquo; Night. I do like the beat and atmosphere of that song though.\nJanuary 26, 2023 The Tunnel I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a moment to be brutally honest with myself for all the public to see. I have no job. No career. No five year plan. No job references. No letter of recommendation. No vehicle. I\u0026rsquo;m staying in a family member\u0026rsquo;s storage room an hour away from the city I know. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid of parties. I\u0026rsquo;m 38, and I have no friends. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m not as good as a writer as I once thought. What I do have going for me is that I stopped drinking wine and vaping cannabis several months ago, and I don\u0026rsquo;t buy snacks, energy drinks, or fast food. When I worked retail I needed two energy drinks (red bull) a day just to keep up with appearances. Now I drink tea or coffee (when I can afford unroasted beans). I\u0026rsquo;m also making just enough with \u0026lsquo;side hustles\u0026rsquo; to pay my bills. I\u0026rsquo;d like to pursue a career as a cloud architect, though my work history, personality, and reputation say otherwise. There we go, mask off, and neck revealed.\nJanuary 27, 2023 Professionalism I have Visual Studio Code configured with Vim emulation and the markdown renderer set for üîó Github Flavored Markdown (GFM). I guess it\u0026rsquo;s time to start working on the markdown formatting of this website. Probably didn\u0026rsquo;t have to file a bug report, but it\u0026rsquo;s decent practice.\n"},{"id":143,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2024/0124/","title":"üìÅ 01-24","parent":"üìÅ 2024","content":" January 1, 2024 SMD for honoring memories January 4, 2024 Nothing Left To Fight For January 6, 2024 Long Live PineTime January 11, 2024 Fine Cinema January 11, 2024 Financially Young January 21, 2024 Dangerous Aliexpress January 29, 2024 Thy Spooky Self January 1, 2024 SMD for honoring memories Squeak squeak.\nFinally ordered SMD soldering stuff.

No work. So I started a Linux experiment. Let\u0026rsquo;s try üîóLinux Mint, what could go wrong? Within 30 minutes I had a üîóLM: 14 Nadia üîóiso booted, now what? I broke it. Blank screen, no mouse or keyboard input. AWESOME! Up until that moment, I had used some form of Microsoft since 1987. Other than the random virus from üîófile sharing applications or a botched üîóregistry tweak, I had never broken an operating system. I loved that about Linux.\nFREEDOM!!!!!\nThe freedom this operating system provided was intoxicating. This was before I learned of course that what I was actually referring to was a operating system üîókernel, and not necessarily the entire operating system. Well, technically the operating system was Linux Mint, so I guess I was technically correct. Which is the best kind of correct.\nFuturama.exe complete\nThis was during an era of my life before reading manuals. I learned to üîóRTFM.\nI prefer to be redundant. Obfuscation impedes progress imo\nAnyway, I have some strong üîóCTC Assam to make before doing a bunch of other stuff. Thought I\u0026rsquo;d refresh my Linux memories a bit before properly starting the year. First look at üîóVentoy kicked my mind gears up a notch as well.\nBetter than a Spice Weasel tbh\nJanuary 6, 2024 Long Live PineTime I\u0026rsquo;ve been a watch person for a while now (MMMM DROP!)\nAfter several attempts to update the firmware of my 2020 PineTime from 13 to 14 I believe it\u0026rsquo;s time to switch back to my Casio F-91W. It was a fun ride and I wish all the maintainers well (and god(s) speed).\nSo many resolved üîóGithub issues too!\nFailed firmware updates has something to do with an Android 14 bug or something like that. From what I understand the üîóissue is nearly resolved. Unfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;ve nearly broken through the glass at this point. As a teenager I broke the band of at least one G-Shock watch (oh he\u0026rsquo;s hard on watches this one).\n2001: My hand nearly slipped in between the seat and the table top of a picnic table while I was using the table \u0026hellip; just as it was made to be used of course, and the watch band popped off. I never lie you know ;)\nIn other news, people can totally live in the center of the Earth. Sure, that\u0026rsquo;s where diamonds were formed (or nearby), so living in the center of the Earth is totally possible. All you have to do is mine the pressure. You know, mine on and whatnot.\nWhatnot. \u0026lt;/storytime\u0026gt; *shrugs*\nJanuary 11, 2024 Fine Cinema ONLY THE BEST!\nSome of my first campy memories are of watching üîóTales from the Crypt from a Jacksonville, FL hotel (1989). Dad fell asleep, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t pull my eyes from the screen. Flying from Bermuda to Florida type jet lag. Probably avoided the üîóTriangle, but still\u0026ndash;that\u0026rsquo;s a long dual flight trip (Bermuda \u0026gt; South Carolina \u0026gt; North Florida).\nI\u0026rsquo;m partial to the üîómethane theory tbh\nIt\u0026rsquo;s definitely inherited, whatever it is that compels me to watch üîóMST3K and movies that should be featured in future episodes (Toho Godzilla ü§û)\nIn the meantime I have a üîó1995 Turkey Day Marathon to watch (complete with commercials!)\nIn other \u0026rsquo;news\u0026rsquo;, I finished the üîóKinT controller after two years of dragging my feet. Actually, it\u0026rsquo;s been so long that there\u0026rsquo;s a new Kinesis Advantage üîókeyboard. Not my style tbh\nSuper professional setup and the hotplate was plugged into a GFCI outlet (that I installed years ago) just in case\nNot sure if I cooked the components, but the board works.. so.. success? (neoprene pad on the keyboard hides the LEDs anyway)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll have a hotplate with temperature sensor for when I put together the backup controller. And since the Teensy 3.6 is üîóno longer manufactured I placed a 4.1 in the same DigiKey üîóBOM I used for the first KinT controller. It took a few minutes for the solder to liquify using the LED strip hot plate (I also had to remove two of the screws)\u0026ndash;slight anxst tbh\nANXST.\nOnce the second build is finished I\u0026rsquo;ll add it to the device/keyboard category of this website.\nCOMING SOON! 2030!\nJanuary 11, 2024 Financially Young Reddit | r/unixp0rn | [i3-gaps] A hint of lemon (08-14-2018)\nAfter three weeks of divine solitude work on a video game video recording side project, I was pushed away from my goal by a group of high-school sophomores. I was only partially at my goal (70 hours, or 2,500 out of the ~10K bound quest items needed). The game shrunk to a point in which these high-schoolers took it upon themselves to target anyone that moved\u0026ndash;especially those with a goal. I found the most efficient way to achieve my goal, and that really bugged them for some reason.\nSo it goes\nWhich brought me to an interesting thought. I keep running into this issue while in hobbyist realms. And it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I dialed in my ADHD symptoms that I got a clear picture of what I was dealing with. Young people assuming I am young too because of my financial situation/ADHD symptoms, and behaving as they would towards a poor peer. Especially poor \u0026lsquo;peers\u0026rsquo; that are organized and hyper focused on a goal.\nStill working on the ADHD symptoms tbh\nStopping me from the goal at that point in time effectively pushed me out of the game. I left on a polite high note, kept all my gear and accounts, and uninstalled the game (never to return again). I don\u0026rsquo;t have time for sophomore games. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time for them in the 10th grade, and I certainly don\u0026rsquo;t have time for those type of games 20 something years later.\nüéµ No-no time for games, she\u0026rsquo;s full grown üéµ\nAnyway, I won\u0026rsquo;t mention the game by name at this point in time as it\u0026rsquo;s not a safe place for like minded individuals to just go about their business. Shrunk population, and most of the positive minded individuals left years ago. Which is why I removed all mention of the game from this blog, and all of my social media accounts. I avoided global chats to avoid them and for whatever reason they got bored enough to show up in the zone I was working out of anyway. Grinding a few hours a day helped me focus on a single thing for a few hours. I can rarely do that effectively. What I saw and experienced was the type of unsafe that leads some to üîóDial 988. They don\u0026rsquo;t even understand how they\u0026rsquo;re projecting all over the place, and it\u0026rsquo;s dangerous.\nI can probably say that I think like an engineer at this point right?\nAnyway, so the point I\u0026rsquo;m getting at is that Florida\u0026rsquo;s/FDA\u0026rsquo;s decision to üîóimport medicine directly from Canada is a step in the right direction. I don\u0026rsquo;t qualify for government assistance; I haven\u0026rsquo;t since November 2012, but maybe it\u0026rsquo;ll help those that need it more.\nSuch things as üîóAspiration Bars never brushed my mind until I was in my late 30s tbh (good stuff)\nAnd if any of them are actually grown and step on the porch of this house I\u0026rsquo;m typing from, I hope they are prepared to take a nap. I may be an optimist, have a goofy face, and joke around a bunch, but I will lose all sense of self to protect my family. Just a friendly warning. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a few of those naps when I was younger, and those naps are less fun than a nap on a couch\u0026ndash;I can say that much.\nObviously, I\u0026rsquo;m avoiding all multi-player games moving forward. Skyrim AE is a better investment imo. Had to pull a few things out my mind to move forward via this blog post. Apologies for the personal clutter\nPlus there are a lot of social norms I missed out on that the average suburbanite observes without leaving their realm of safety. That may have been another piece of the puzzle that I was missing out on.\nAwkward-ing all over the place is my specialty tbh. No tact. Only wit and guile, but I\u0026rsquo;m working on it\nJanuary 21, 2024 Dangerous Aliexpress TMW: Looking for silicone thermal pads and you get the age verification pop-up \u0026lt;\u0026rsquo;(-_-)'\u0026gt;\nSacrificial APC surge protectors.

That\u0026rsquo;s just to configure the customizable display options. If it can display an image, it can display an itty bitty custom webpage.

While yes the book was written for children, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of interesting mile markers along the way. Also, I was a child when the book was written. So, uh, nostalgia? Right, for one mile marker, R.L. Stine mentions that he spent so much time as an awkward observer rather than a participant, that it was natural for him to continue doing so to research and flesh out his characters. I mean, he is a father, and he did mention he watched a lot of TV. When I was reading Goosebumps books as a kid (most likely all of 1-50 at least once), I was reading from the perspective of this mythical middle class lifestyle I knew nothing about, and that forbidden knowledge helped shape who I am now. So naturally, I appreciates all that research.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what editors would say about these pages.\n\u0026ldquo;These words \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; *twitchy jestures*\nAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;m going to make an honest attempt to scoop up all the songs in the music blog and create a YouTube playlist.

I mean, by my various gods, attempting to install all the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) systems again would take up an entire 40 hour work week. As would a single Arch Linux, or Slackware system.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, that gif above reminds me of how I feel about dating. Back when The Office (US) first aired, I was in a long distance online relationship. Which is probably way more popular in 2023. It only lasted a year, because I was way too immature for her. Webcams, microphones, text messaging, eating instant ramen to save for flights to Toronto. I learned that I really like snow. I also saw how my hair is suppose to look for the first time.

Apps installed as Snaps seem to update automatically, and in my experience, Snaps don\u0026rsquo;t integrate well with notifications. Which is fine for others, but for me there are times when a notification equals a limited time opportunity to earn some money. Also, for some reason I have to RMB and Copy Link Location to visit links from emails viewed with Thunderbird. If I don\u0026rsquo;t copy the link Thunderbird, will open a blank tab in a new Firefox window. It\u0026rsquo;s just.. what happened? I\u0026rsquo;m thinking I may try Debian KDE with backports and some manually compiled software. Wait, did I just describe Linux Mint?

Such a weird commodity. These days a tricked out keyboard sells faster than a rare DVD or video game. And early 2020 was definitely the time to buy cheap vintage mechanical keyboards. Anyway, I have a few extra Linux operating systems on the SSD of the computer I\u0026rsquo;m typing this from. I should at least switch one out for Linux Mint.\nBy the way, the notes I take of Linux Mint or Debian, or whatever operating system that comes next won\u0026rsquo;t be cluttered with a bunch of words. I\u0026rsquo;ve saved these Blog. pages to clutter with a bunch of words instead. This should be obvious by now.

Now it looks like I\u0026rsquo;ll need to get a new CM246 chipset, and a decent hot air gun specifically for soldering.\nWell, at least I know there is a power issue, and where the excess heat was coming from. So far I\u0026rsquo;ve replaced the CPU/GPU thermal paste with üîó Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut paste. When I unplugged/plugged the CMOS battery so that the Thinkpad would roar back to life is when the chipset blew. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it was from cleaning with üîó 99.9% Isopropyl alcohol. And the thermal paste I used is non-conductive.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll get some testing equipment to check all the üîó mosfets. Someone from Lenovo\u0026rsquo;s refurb division (or from one of the refurb divisions) covered the center drain hole with a refurb sticker, and the inside did show evidence of a minor spill. Fingers crossed that ~$250 and some hot air work will bring this $1,200 laptop back to life. I guess my luxurious YouTube career will have to wait *chuckles*.\nThinkpad X1 Extreme Gen. 2 bad battery and good INTEL CM246 chipset\nThinkpad X1 Extreme Gen. 2 blown CM246 chipset\nFebruary 20, 2023 The truth about soldering laptop chipsets Lots of bravado with puffed out chest regarding my soldering prowess. Some engineer decided to play a prank on me and add some components to the bottom of the board underneath the chipset. I\u0026rsquo;m not a surgeon, or a doctor, or someone that knows how to solder all that well, so ah, that\u0026rsquo;s not happening.\nCan\u0026rsquo;t even use a soldering hot plate, and the solder balls under the chip cover the entire chip, so I doubt hot air will work the way I imagined. And since the C THING has brought down prices on laptops due to more people working remotely, a used replacement motherboard is the same price as a Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3. I have some decisions to make, and none of which involve attempting to pour more money in to this very dead laptop.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still not sure whether or not I allowed enough time for the alcohol to dry when I was cleaning up the motherboard in preparation for solder paste. What are the chances of a two year old mosfet going bad? I\u0026rsquo;d imagine a very slim chance. So unless the battery was bad enough to cause the issue, I probably fried the laptop. Thankfully the laptop technically paid for itself before I killed it, so that\u0026rsquo;s nice *chuckles nervously*.\nFebruary 22, 2023 The Swinging Vine Farm I don\u0026rsquo;t have much to say in this entry. Just an excuse to maybe inspire a certain web comic to feature a Swinging Vine Farm. The only comic with the stones to skip the Tarzan motif. We all know a British person could never survive on jungle water. It would be irresponsible to assume otherwise.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t care to receive credit for the idea\u0026ndash;just really want to read the comic\u0026ndash;of a Swinging Vine Farm.

It was 2009 by a few months, and the typical sunny Florida deposition.\nPretty sure I worked at that location for another six months before I mixed up my day off with my day on. No call no shows accidental or not led to termination. I guess I was one of the lucky ones.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t talk about the events that happened afterwards, this is about the moments leading up to finding an open microphone at the casino. I\u0026rsquo;m still processing and coping with the events that happened afterwards. Some events were more dangerous than others, but I survived all of it. If I was given the chance to do it all over again I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have changed a thing. Even the part of the story in which I lived out of my car during two blistering summer months. My fault regarding my used Honda Civic hatchback living arrangement and my lack of air conditioning. Having thousands of roommates all of a sudden was definitely illuminating too.\nI was called to the casino from the race track to pop a new recept roll in a DIY parimutuel wagering machine. TOTE is short for Totalitarian, which is a fancy word for tabulator. We fixed and replaced anything to do with betting equipment. More famously, we made sure the giant race track display was working. All the flipping of numbers and letters. I was known as an operator, and during my shifts I mostly dealt with the self help betting machines. Capacitive touch display Windows devices, or older DOS based resistive touch display models. If needed we would replace all parts other than the money collector of these machines. If someone smashed a screen in anger we\u0026rsquo;d replace it\u0026ndash;after the anger party was escorted from the premisses. During the busy hours (days when races were scheduled at Pompano Park) a technician would take care of the nuts and bolts while the operators took care of the virtual stuff. Server type things using a black and green DOS program\u0026ndash;via thin clients. Tracking down lost club cards, canceling wagers generated with stolen money or club cards, etc.\nUnited TOTE pay stub from 2009. Used my nickname for that job *shrugs*\nThe hum of the server rack took a while to get use to. Those towers start to speak to you if you\u0026rsquo;re not paying attention. It\u0026rsquo;s gets lonely at times in the TOTE room. Especially while running the technician shift. I picked up a technician shift for a month and worked 90 hours a week. I guess it had been a while since our tech went on vacation. Had I not, I might not have had a car to live out of for those two illuminating months.\nAnyway, so it was a normal call from the casino. I was one of the operators on duty, which if memory serves me was from 10am - 6pm (daytime). The phone rang, on the other end I heard something like, \u0026ldquo;Need paper on number 300 something\u0026rdquo;. Second floor of the casino, near the bar and poker tables. The night before I was perfecting my rendition of Aesop Rock\u0026rsquo;s None Shall Pass for karaoke. Headphones on, play the song, and sing along. Once I got the lyrics down I\u0026rsquo;d make a few practice recordings using a desktop computer to get the timing and voicing dialed in. That\u0026rsquo;s why I was so consistent when I sung Intergalactic by the Beastie Boys. If you were a fly on the outside of my room you\u0026rsquo;d probably hear my rehearsing all these different songs.\nSo yea, stucco folks re-did the stucco around a bunch of the apartments where we staid, and a well meaning friend looked something up on Google using an apartment computer that drew some attention towards us (nearly certain the place was re-stuccoed after he used Google). Tiled roofs, and colorful stucco\u0026ndash;very South Florida stylized gated apartments. Still not sure why there were so many dudes wearing sunglasses walking around German shepard\u0026rsquo;s. Stucco folks were all over the balcony, and the walls. Dunno.\nI knew there were eyes and ears pointed in our direction, but it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to sum up the scope of it all when you\u0026rsquo;re in it. Some were tactics to unhinge, and other tactics were to evaluate. This was the tail end of the surveillance era that spawned from September 2001. Where were the eyes and ears? How close where they really? It\u0026rsquo;s enough to unhinge even the brightest of minds. Especially the prerecorded audio.\nWith a roll of thermal paper in hand I made my way to the casino to complete the task. We were instructed to follow casino procedures and enter the casino at the security checkpoint. We\u0026rsquo;d usually just pass through that location under optimal surveillance. For operator tasks that required work on the first floor slot machine area wagering machine we\u0026rsquo;d need security escort. I disliked waiting for the elevator knowing someone was waiting for me to fix something, so I bypassed all of that. A sidewalk led around Pompano Park and two flights of stairs led up to the side of the casino. Got my steps in or whatever. Still the era in which the word pedometer casted some suspicion.\nThere was a picnic table that no one used at the back corner of Pompano Park that I walked past for nearly every call. What I didn\u0026rsquo;t know, was that someone parked themselves on top of the picnic table before I got the call. Just before I left our tech for the night said she\u0026rsquo;d replace the roll, and mumbled something about a microphone. My ears perked up\u0026ndash;I\u0026rsquo;ve been sitting for a while, so I decided I\u0026rsquo;d take the call. \u0026ldquo;Are you sure?\u0026rdquo; There was some apprehension in her voice, like I might be making a big mistake. \u0026ldquo;Yep, I got it.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, as I passed the picnic table the dude posting out on top during his break flashed a smile at me. Friendly but cautious. I remember there being an extra gleam to his smile. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to forget a well placed gold tooth or two.\nIt was that moment when I switched the song in my head. My idea to sing None Shall Pass that started with \u0026ldquo;flash that buttery gold\u0026rdquo; dropped off in favor of Bad Religion\u0026rsquo;s Sorrow. A song about the why there\u0026rsquo;s sorrow, and how to affect change. It\u0026rsquo;s not a song I\u0026rsquo;ve sung at bars that host karaoke nights, so this was uncharted territory. I use to listen to Bad Religion when I was a kid\u0026ndash;not because I\u0026rsquo;ve been burned by Christianity, but because it\u0026rsquo;s punk rock. I grew up with The Beatles, Abba, Beastie Boys, and a bunch of alternative rock and roll bands. My Mom took me to both the library (1 hour internet sessions), and the local record shop. I picked up on a lot of interesting concepts shortly after middle school. Bad Religion made sense to me at the time. I guess one can say that going to the library and record store for me was like going to church for other people. Before the age of 12 I had witnessed an attempted murder on my school bus, and the local gas station was robbed at least four times while the manager counted money\u0026ndash;so it was nice to see what the rest of the world was doing at the time.\nI walked up the two flights of stairs, added new receipt paper to the machine that needed it, and then I found the microphone.\nThe microphone was opposite the bar. I paced near it for 10-20 seconds weighing all my options. I remember this vividly, because as I sang, one person turned around in his barstool to see the person that had just found a live microphone. I checked it first. \u0026ldquo;Father can you hear me?\u0026rdquo;, I sung into the microphone. A timid yet effectively audible singing voice. There was a response. I caught the attention of the one bar patron as well. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall was said over the PA/intercom system\u0026ndash;something like \u0026ldquo;that was interesting\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;I knew the microphone was still tied in with whatever was being announced at the moment. Poker tournament? Was it tied in to a radio station? I had no idea. I tried again, this time with a bit more confidence. I made it close to the end of verse 2 of the song before someone interrupted me. Maybe someone went on a bathroom break before realizing they left the microphone on. I never had the chance to ask him lol. A person responsible for the microphone setup asked me my name as he grabbed the microphone from my hand, and after a moment of silence they swiped at my badge to see my identification. We drank a bunch back them, sometimes bar hopping, though I rarely drank anything other than beer and wasn\u0026rsquo;t hungover. My instinct took hold, and out popped an old memory. At the time I couldn\u0026rsquo;t place that I had recalled the lesson of R. L. Stine\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;How I Learned to Fly\u0026rdquo;, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Wanting zero notoriety I grabbed my ID tag in my hand, and went the one way most had trouble following\u0026ndash;down two flights of stairs. By the time I was on the sidewalk the person chasing me had just bust through the doors of the casino.\nThe whole premise of the song is why I\u0026rsquo;m revisiting an old fishing spot on the 14th. It was at that fishing spot when I sprang the bad news of my first failed grade. It was at that fishing spot where I learned what failing a grade meant\u0026ndash;grounded for the next semester. And it was at that very fishing spot when my symptoms of ADHD reared their easily distracted heads. Unnoticed, because of how tied together ADHD symptoms are with general adolescence.\nHow many semesters was I to only speak when spoken to? How many summers were used to teach me a lesson? How many books did I read instead of doing something to sooth my ADHD symptoms afterschool? How many chores did I start at 6am on the weekends? We woke up around 5am to have fun fishing one morning, and the next morning we woke up at 5am and I silently went about my new chores for the day. Fallen trees needed to be moved. Grass needed to be mowed and bagged. No laughing. No joking. Occasional roof top antenna adjustments. Tigers can be very fucking serious when they suspect something isn\u0026rsquo;t quite right. When chores were done there was no video games. No phone calls (never knew when someone called either). And certainly no skateboarding, bicycles, or basketball. The only two activities acceptable other than staring at my math homework hoping the answer would appear were listening to the radio, and reading.\nAnd like I said earlier in this post, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have changed a thing if I had to do it all over again. Well, maybe I would be less callous the second time around. I might not adhere to a religion, but I do adhere to being a decent person. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to over the years anyway. When you dissect even my darkest moment, I was more awkward than I was aggressive. Still had enough sense in me to wear a raincoat when prompted, even when I was blackout drunk.\nSo yea, Tigers never stand still. lol\nFebruary 8, 2024 Mr. Fruity Pebbles How tough is an AWD manual transmission van? Asking for a friend..\nYesterday I was watching üîóThe Real Ghostbusters when it dawned on me, üîóBill Murray did not provide the voice for the cartoon-ized Dr. Peter Venkman.

I pulled the unit out of the wall, and found loads of pollen (surprise surprise). I also found dead barnacles inside that wall.

It almost feels as if poison is coursing through the bloodstream. A poison that enters the mind and propels people into this automated mecha state of survival.

That slight hesitation before a handshake. The awkward smiles as they hold your phone for you. The fading of interest during social interactions.

Kev has Jim\u0026rsquo;s back yo\nI posted a song by Ratatat called Seventeen Years in üîó Music Blog for March 2023. I feel like I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to say this, because I\u0026rsquo;ve been an adult since 2003, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t write the song Seventeen Years. The music was created by Ratatat (lyrics by Young Churf). The video was created by a bunch of talented artists. The premise of the video is about rainforest deforestation, habitation destruction, and the effects it has on the planet. Raccoons seem to be globally recognized creatures, so it makes sense they were used in the video instead of Toucan Sam or King Kong.\nI guess I have another story to tell after all. When I was ten I helped Dad build a fenced in area for a garden. Which sounds normal right? Wild animals eat unprotected produce all the time. So, I chopped down all the small crab apple trees required (by myself) with a normal sized axe, cut the trees to length, and then we assembled the fence. I wanted to cut down more trees, because that\u0026rsquo;s fun right? No access to 90s cable TV type boredom. I guess I was posturing during a conversation, so Dad bet me that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t cut down a medium sized oak tree that was way to close to the house. Just a prideful bet.\nNaturally, I woke up early the next morning and spent six hours chopping into that oak tree. Did I mention it was close to the house? What happened next was like a scene out of that show the Beverly Hillbillies. The tree nearly took out the bay window on the side of our double wide mobile home. We lived within biking distance of a pond, and Dad couldn\u0026rsquo;t drive anymore due to reasons, so that was cool.\nThe town was so tiny that the middle school was also a high school (grades 6-12..). The magnet program for that school was agricultural, which included real life cows. Not at a nearby pasture, there was a literal cow pasture attached to the side of the high school. Like, people showed up to class in literal cowboy boots (lots of rattlesnakes in Hawthorne, FL). Instead of this example of a morning announcement: \u0026ldquo;the owner of the blue Corolla left their lights on\u0026rdquo;, morning announcements where more like: \u0026ldquo;the owner of the blue chevy left a shotgun in their gun rack\u0026rdquo;. I went to both types of schools, and the same inflection was used for either announcement.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s my point? I don\u0026rsquo;t have one. Also, I never developed a fear for dentists. That\u0026rsquo;s not it.\nMarch 24, 2023 Goat on a diving board Those darn kids!\nMagnesia Springs was a strange place in the early 90s..\nI can\u0026rsquo;t see myself shilling out this website on Reddit or Imgur. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure I could pull off a post that ends in positive numbers on those websites. My social media presence as a whole is statuesque at best.\nIf it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for a mixture of insanity and a love for this quirky thing known as Linux, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have themed out this site and wrote all these gosh darn notes.\nWith all that said, not one single click from Google searches. I guess my SEO skills are on par with my social media skills.\nI like to build things, cut wood into smaller pieces, and design trinkets for 3D printing. I recently sketched out an existing porch in Blender 3D. The porch steps need handrails, so ah, that\u0026rsquo;ll be fun.\nMarch 29, 2023 Every of the time Sharks of Scranton, PA\nAbout a week ago I traded my busted Thinkpad for a packet of magic legumes. A few days ago a neck tie and a Logitech Streamcam grew out of those very fine legumes. Now if I could only rock the square toed dress shoe that John Krasinski wears in The Office (S07E19 - Garage Sale). I\u0026rsquo;d be the talk of every virtual meeting. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about me, I won\u0026rsquo;t be handing out all my millions though. I learned as a kid that I should only give my money to those in need (or at least someone I\u0026rsquo;m acquainted with IRL), and I\u0026rsquo;ve stuck to that principle ever since. Also social media comments. Can\u0026rsquo;t be giving away all that comment gold right?\nAnyway, I just recently developed a very serious addiction to Skyrim, so I added a üîó note about fixing input lag (keyboard/mouse). Speaking of input lag, there\u0026rsquo;s an Xbox One controller on this desk, but I\u0026rsquo;ll leave the controller input lag testing to the controller experts. I use this controller for sports games like skateboarding, fishing, \u0026amp; racing\u0026ndash;oh and I guess indie games too. I\u0026rsquo;ll also leave the game play and walkthrough details to the very kind and very capable PC/console game Tubers.\nOh, and one more thing. I guess I should include the porch sketch I made via CGI software with a namesake of a certain kitchen appliance. Toaster 3D. The sketch was made just to illustrate what was in my head. Let\u0026rsquo;s call it a project approval sketch (not my porch). I had to relearn the software, so it took about five hours. I\u0026rsquo;m new to pocket holes, Japanese pull saws, and Japanese wood rasps, so this\u0026rsquo;ll be interesting. I won\u0026rsquo;t be posting photos due to privacy concerns. And if the steps have any lateral wiggle, I\u0026rsquo;ll ask a neighbor for a cup of hammer drill and Tapcons to help screw it down. That\u0026rsquo;s what people do right? They ask neighbors for random stuff? When I built the steps I placed pavers under the steps to prevent any Z axis slippage. So if needed I can anchor the steps to the concrete pavers.\nI use to use Tapcon anchors to secure residential A/C condensers to precast concrete pads when I was an HVAC mechanic. And I built a lot of aluminum boxes. Lots of box making in that job. Good god, those tin snipes they showed in The Office (S08E09 - Mrs. California) would have been extremely helpful. Precast leveling, copper brazing, wading through fiberglass, strapping, flex ducts, building fiberglass boxes, building PVC drain pipes, and trying not to catch the customer(s) on fire with the oxyacetylene torch. Some customers couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out that a torch hot enough to weld silver to copper is dangerous. My acting role was HVAC Mechanic, but I guess that\u0026rsquo;s not my typecast. For some reason there\u0026rsquo;s a LOT of typecasting here in North Central Florida.\nHandrail sketch with a Hollywood facade, and without fancy lighting or material textures added.\n"},{"id":147,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2024/0324/","title":"üìÅ 03-24","parent":"üìÅ 2024","content":" March 2, 2024 Fitbit Sense 2 (Google) March 4, 2024 3D Printing March 7, 2024 The Four Horsemen March 8, 2024 Gaslighting March 9, 2024 Ultrasounds March 10, 2024 How I Became Invisible March 12, 2024 AI Wrangler March 13, 2024 Wrong Data March 14, 2024 Schammert\u0026rsquo;s Prussian Origin Story March 15, 2024 Engine Breaking March 20, 2024 This Old Computer March 21, 2024 Linux Mint Again March 2, 2024 Fitbit Sense 2 (Google) Pretty great\nAfter a week of wearing my Sense 2 the üîóSmart Wake feature became a VERY compelling feature.\nFirst off, I should start off by implicitly stating that I do not care where the data is sent. It\u0026rsquo;s a Google device meant to be paired with Android, which are two notoriously implicit companies in the mind of the public regarding the distribution of private data.\nOk, disclaimer out of the way.

Unfortunately, this means that you\u0026rsquo;ll only hear Alexa\u0026rsquo;s voice.\nShe does say good morning or good afternoon in a way that matches my Da Bears talking cadence. So that\u0026rsquo;s not weird.\nNo music support.

I activated all the health data notifications on the watch, and that cascaded to an interesting side effect. I became more aware of my watch\u0026ndash;as if the notifications have drilled into my subconscious which triggered in me an acute hyper awareness of the watch while I slept.\nWe have bonded.

It takes a lot for me not to like someone. I think that we all have our own super hero like quirks, and most people are decent and unique.\nI FEAR A 3D PRINTED PLANET! (tongue and cheek)\nMy family made a big deal out of DIY growing up. Everything was a DIY project. Make shelves. Make butcher block table. Replace various sized belts. Make tree house platform. Troubleshoot why thing leaks. Troubleshoot why car won\u0026rsquo;t start. Transplant R/C car parts into a custom boat shell and watch while it takes on water. Follow instructions. Turn picnic table into ping pong table. 3D printing seemed like an extension of traditional DIY, so I was compelled to be a part of it, even for just a little bit.\nFDM prints in Nylon \u0026hellip; sheeesh\nJust cuz\nLike I said before, when I worked at CVS (even as a shift supervisor) I hid from the public. I\u0026rsquo;d organize the stockroom instead of whatever it was that was happening in the store. I\u0026rsquo;d choose to move gallon water displays and 12pk soda displays instead of register duty.\n6pk gallon water displays for hurricane season? Yes, please.\nI KNOW I am not alone when I say that I still enjoy amazing YouTube videos from the 3D printing community. Please keep it going. You\u0026rsquo;ve got this, and you know it.\n*High. Five.*\nMarch 7, 2024 The Four Horsemen Csmertx (2016)\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had a healthy fear of horses, cows, and other large four legged animals for as long as I can remember. Ironic that I ended up working at a horse racing track in my early twenties. Also ironic considering the main magnet program for my first middle school (grades 6-12) was agriculture.\nMore afraid of horses than I am of sharks tbh\nLong time ago I was known as Sharky because of my teeth, and probably because I never stopped skating. Wherever, whenever, my fingers clutched the nose of my board even when my hand ached. Always ready to throw down and skate. I only held the board by the trucks when provoked (wasn\u0026rsquo;t often). This was the same timeline in which Dad would use his non-callused hands to check my mine for calluses. It was when I watched a cut partially close during a visit to a local beach when I recognized why my calluses seem to just fall off. Superficial stuff. Besides, why not gloves?\nWhen I broke a skateboard bearing for the first time I wore it as a ring lol\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;m afraid of all animals. It\u0026rsquo;s also not like I\u0026rsquo;m out there feeding squirrels or communing with nature\u0026ndash;they can bite through sk.., well, they supplement their diets with protein, and they don\u0026rsquo;t leave much behind. I was in the wilderness long enough to see the carnage and understand that as a species we came out of that mess. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to separate one self from the encoding that echoes back through the ages. That\u0026rsquo;s the essence that separates Us from the beasts. We can see ourselves from the eyes of others, and not just from our own perspective. Which is crucial for inner growth.\nSeriously, squirrels are not to be truffled with\nUsing üîófast math to see the forest for the trees\nAs a side note, the trick to fishing efficiently on an ultra budget is to use grasshoppers. Find a butterfly net or a large fish tank net and a field that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been groomed at just the right time. Dew point is important. Grasshoppers crawl to the top of grass to lick the dew before they eat. Even the larger üîóeastern lubber grasshopper makes for great top water action. Theoretically, the larger the grasshopper, the larger the fish. One thing to keep in mind is that although grasshoppers are great for top water fish, they\u0026rsquo;re also a crunchy snack for turtles. Highest risk of üîóSalmonella, and a real pain in the ass to unhook. Anyway, hold the net so the middle of it is inline with the tops of the grass, and run. Load the haul into a critter keeper, and keep collecting until you have enough. Make sure to collect a few more than you need\u0026ndash;I mean, they\u0026rsquo;re grasshoppers. IIRC, there\u0026rsquo;s a place to thread the hook through the backs of grasshoppers (through the carapace).\n\u0026ldquo;Bro, do you even collect grasshoppers and mount them?\u0026rdquo; *Rides Grasshopper into Sunset*\nOne of my fishing experiments from my elementary school days.

They\u0026rsquo;re very good at what they do, and their hyper-focused minds use fast math to save lives. They keep their minds sharp, and their observations sharper. Their movements are coupled with an air of indifference and emotional detachment. It\u0026rsquo;s a pity that these vampires are always caught off guard\u0026ndash;vampire hunters are rarely a concern for the those that lack hubris. Honeyed words mean nothing to these hunters. They\u0026rsquo;re trained to detect the slightest of shaky hand movements, and breathing cadence with an unwavering gaze. And they all have the patience of a saint. They also earn their own money, so why would they want yours?\nNovelist you say? Well now, I should probably pick out a typewriter. Hermes 3000? Royal? Olivetti?

One of the first things I did was push them away as much as I could. Skipped a lot of holidays and birthdays. Way more than I\u0026rsquo;d like to think about. After a few years of unemployment I thought that I didn\u0026rsquo;t deserve the title of Uncle anymore. Staying invisible meant not being able to fully project my personality during interviews. Even at 245 pounds, I came across as meek and timid.\nWho? Why? What? Where? I had no idea. It became obvious recently. So I at least know the why, and the where now.\nI was afraid to answer the phone for several years. I was afraid to use a public bathroom again (robbed in HS). I was afraid to share my opinions, and I was afraid to hold conversations with strangers. My ADHD symptoms were aggravated, and my progress was regressed. Even my social media posts were devoid of passion after the first year. And too many voices in restaurants to keep my mind in the conversation.\nSymptoms aggravated to the level experienced at age 12\nA visit to where I scattered my fathers ashes really drove home how much I\u0026rsquo;ve changed. On the same sidewalk I use to skate down to reach downtown, I stumbled as I walked. My walking cadence was a cross between a limp from an old injury and someone that forgot how to walk more than 10-15 feet.\nMaking coffee, preparing meals, etc.\nJust like when I first jumped on my skateboard in 2022, I thought it would all come back. The muscles I use to walk atrophied a little. Thinking about walking was another thing I hadn\u0026rsquo;t done since I was 12. Where to point my toes, how long my strides are suppose to be, and the spatial reasoning of my feet needed tuning. Kept dragging my feet, because I forgot how high I needed to lift them for each stride. I lift light weights to help with shoulder mobility\u0026ndash;squatting with 50 LB helped too.\nMom\u0026rsquo;s cats were my little saviors tho\nMom had three cats that would occasionally say hello. One often laid in common areas and meowed when anyone was within petting range. And I was duty bound by cat rules to abide or suffer the consequences (louder meows).\nOrange cat fury tho\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how family felt about me. I know I was a burden on resources, and I tried to mitigate that by keeping track of what I ate. I was obviously stress eating, and was afraid I was burning through too much money. I also turned away from a few jobs simply because I thought I\u0026rsquo;d either quit in the first six months or would fail the job interview. These jobs were Hardee\u0026rsquo;s, McDonald\u0026rsquo;s, and overnight stocking for Walmart. The same Walmart I applied to for the better part of two years before I quit the overnight gas station attendant job. I drove to the interviews, and staid in the car while thinking to myself, \u0026ldquo;WHAT THE F ARE YOU DOING?!\u0026rdquo; Technically I was hired for a retail auditing job, though driving 1-5 hours a day wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option. Previous vehicles were swallowed by impound.\nI volunteered my time to pry apart and stack a 20 FT x 20 FT deck (solo), so it\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;m lazy\nWatching sports was like watching software engineers write code. My ADHD symptoms twisted the information into something completely different. My brain processed hidden meanings in everything, including vanity plates, and road signs. I had to re-read newspaper columns to phase out the extra noise and absorb the information. Fight or flight on and off for years takes its toll on cognitive reasoning. When I moved from South Florida I was so adverse to talking I was probably scaring my friends. Also thought I could FEEL radar guns (I couldn\u0026rsquo;t). Occasionally the old me would appear, then I\u0026rsquo;d realize my \u0026rsquo;error\u0026rsquo; and snap back to looking like an unflinching stone.\nOne person slammed his hand on the gas station counter as I scanned his stuff into the register just to see if I\u0026rsquo;d flinch. I did not. I should have flinched, but I did not.\nA group of peers showed up at the gas station I attended suggesting I try security at the Target across the street. My gaze was as if I\u0026rsquo;d seen combat\u0026ndash;which was far from the truth. I was also more than qualified to work in the electronics department (sans credit history). My first visit with friends in years included me smiling at a friend as if I knew something no one else knew about him. I didn\u0026rsquo;t, but that\u0026rsquo;s how it is when you think everyone is out to get you. I had to work extra hard to dispel those internalized biases. Two years working as an impartial social media evaluator dialed out the last echos of that side of things.\nI once proved the intelligence of a predecessor president by pointing to his college credentials (Dad consistently referred to him a draft dodger)\nThey let me go because they wanted results\u0026ndash;right away. No doubt blindsided by the rush of posts that accumulated during The Pandemic. I believe I mentioned this before\u0026ndash;2020 was before the filters captured posts showcasing child abuse, dismemberment, and other things no one should see\u0026ndash;I still can\u0026rsquo;t shake some of the posts from my mind (some did not violate TOS).\nYou Gotta Do What You Gotta Do¬Æ\nMy prayers (raised with Lutheran values) shifted from \u0026ldquo;job\u0026rdquo; to nothing at all. I lost all of the compassion I once had for religion. Instead I adopted a spirituality void of any known god that adheres to core values of Christian morality.\n\u0026ldquo;The Needs of the Many Outweigh the Needs of the Few\u0026rdquo;\nLike a side note I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before, during my two years of remote work I witnessed security footage of mist apparitions I could not dissect as a skeptic. It was like something from Star Trek, and years before the release of general purpose image generators. During my early days as a photo lab technician I educated myself on distinguishing between üîóorbs made by camera flashes to images with more compelling camera work. My first Android phone captured something interesting as well.\nStill a skeptic as to the how, and why, but less about the what.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a way out please dial or text üîó988\nHeck, writing to ChatGPT is better than \u0026lsquo;just dealing with it\u0026rsquo;\nWhat do you get when a pair a pineapple with a soccer ball?\nToo much time on your hands.\nMarch 12, 2024 AI Wrangler Coffee. Real strong coffee. Shaken not stirred.\nMost of my earnings come from AI Wrangling, or evaluating AI for accuracy and morality. Some of what I do involves adding to data sets. Some of the tasks are digital research studies.\nAdding to data sets involves clicking radio buttons, dragging sliders, games of chance, and talking into the microphone (to name a few).\nOne of my favorite tasks was to trick the AI into a crime. The AI found the cheapest sawdust for sale in China, and then helped me find the cheapest and smallest empty gel capsules as well. Tiny capsules which would be sold for $60 a piece. It knew that I intended to use the ingredients to make a fake diet pill empire. And that took a lot of mental gymnastics to pull off. Obviously this was in a sandboxed and sanitized environment, and this was a few years ago. I can\u0026rsquo;t reveal which AI, but I can assure you that it will never help someone do that again.\nThe researchers slapped the AI on the wrist. Bad AI.

Hatchet Edition\nYesterday, I was one of 25 waiting to see a judge for missing jury duty. I learned that camping belts don\u0026rsquo;t work well with dress pants, and that delivering the court summons factored to a $40 charge per person. Technically, that\u0026rsquo;s the fine ($40) for missing jury duty in my county. Also, that\u0026rsquo;s technically a $40 delivery fee for a piece of paper saying that I was to be in court on such day for such offense.

NDL records of their journey were destroyed during WWII. This post is based on U.S. American records preserved and digitized by the state of Baltimore, Maryland.\nGreat-great-grandfather Herman Schammert (23)\nGreat-great-grandmother Marie Schammert (25)\nGreat Grandfather Herman Schammert (4)\nFrom the port of Baltimore, Maryland they most likely traveled along the freshly built Baltimore \u0026amp; Ohio Railroad (B\u0026amp;O) which was within walking distance from their origin port of Baltimore.\nTwo weeks in steerage, with an hour of fresh air each day, and then 2‚Äì3 days by B\u0026amp;O to reach Chicago, IL. Survival was not a guarantee in steerage. Dozens of families in bunk beds all crammed together attempting to breathe the same air. For more, see the Family Search link üîóhere.\nAbout the Koln and the üîóNDL:\nThe Koln (1870-1895) was a steam-powered vessel that shipped people to the U.S. via steerage (bring your own mattress), and then shipped goods via steerage on the journey back to Bremerhaven, Prussia. In 1895, it was sold to be scrapped.\nThe Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping company was established in 1857, and saw extensive growth under the German Empire.\nThe shipping company advertised one way trips to New York City, and Baltimore, partially because some of those trips were incentivized by the Prussian government. It was cheaper to ship people out of the country than it was to pay for their lifetime of welfare. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine passage in February was especially inexpensive for those wanting a fresh start in the New World.\nSide Note: it‚Äôs said that German Empire citizens of the late 1800s brought protesting with them to U.S. America. Also, hamburgers, kindergarten, and sauerkraut.\nOne day I‚Äôll try sauerkraut on a pizza.

Actually, I went out to \u0026lsquo;vape\u0026rsquo; on the back steps a few weeks ago and I overheard one of my neighbors say, \u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s how rich people do it.\u0026rdquo; This area is well versed in cannabis (lol). I have rolled em by hand, but it\u0026rsquo;s a 25% gamble as to whether or not I dump herb into my lap. New CBD/Delta 8 strain (legal) is called Chewy, prob because only Chewbacca could handle this level of sticky icky. Vaping it because every time I smoke it from the beaker bong I cough.

Since 2022 I\u0026rsquo;ve averaged 2-4 drinks a year. I use to average 12-20 drinks a week. Even quality THCa is cheaper than 12-20 drinks a week.

That cartoon and that movie were both cucumbers. Not as bad as those really awful videos of people scaring their cats with zucchinis and cucumbers, but dang.

While I don\u0026rsquo;t have fond memories of this movie from childhood (I have no idea why I missed it tbh), I see what they mean about making an attempt to create a movie that sparks the imagination. The slimy fungus shown on the sets were humanoid mushrooms that were \u0026lsquo;de-evolved\u0026rsquo; using the equipment funded by King Koopa. And there were several nods to Mario Bros. lore that I must have missed.\nCucumber is not the word I should have used.

Besides, in this neighborhood there\u0026rsquo;s a chance that a middle aged man wobbling on an electric scooter will whizz by and honk at me before I reach the mailbox\u0026ndash;though now that I think about it, that does sound somewhat entertaining. Also, in case it wasn\u0026rsquo;t annoyingly obvious, I am an introverted white man in my late thirties, so I pull more aggro than most other people in this neighborhood. I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s clear now why a walk would likely compound my issues into a more tightly wound ball of issues.\nPulling aggro is a reference to heavily armored characters in RPG games that attract the boss monster\u0026rsquo;s attention\nAt the moment it\u0026rsquo;s impossible for me to find joy in filming/producing a video or posting a goofy faced photo of myself to social media. I know the extent of my \u0026lsquo;social influence\u0026rsquo;, and I know myself, which is to say that it\u0026rsquo;s not likely to happen anytime soon without the very chemical substances that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to avoid. That and I\u0026rsquo;m worried about more than just myself. When I worked the retail side of a small pharmacy, I dreaded being stuck behind a register. Restacking a few hundred 12 packs of soda was a treat for me, because it kept me away from the registers. I bet no one could figure out why I wanted to reorganize shelves in the backroom. Climb the 8ft ladder to grab something from loft storage? Yep, on it.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s clear that I\u0026rsquo;m a behind the scenes type of person. This is something I learned about myself right after grade school.\nAs a person that has gone through a metaphorical tunnel filled with people that behave like vampires and zombies, it\u0026rsquo;s a real blow to my morale when I have seen the light at the end of the tunnel, and people have the mental wherewithal to say that the light is actually a train hurtling towards me. I see the utility of this train of thought (snort), but damn. I mean\u0026ndash;I had to wear vampire and zombie costumes to blend in well enough to reach the areas to climb high enough to see the light in the first place. I think the assumption is that this is a typical train tunnel, with trains chugging along on time hauling cargo and or people. The only train I\u0026rsquo;ve rode in Florida reminds me of the very nice train from the movie/book Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. In this particular metaphorical tunnel, the engineers have retired, the trains have been decommissioned and sent to museums or moved to another state. There\u0026rsquo;s also mounds of debris that one has to climb. And believe me, if a train was coming towards me, I\u0026rsquo;d have my worm hooks ready for me to hitch a ride out (partially joking).\nThe part about the train tunnel written above was inspired by the book \u0026ldquo;An Unquiet Mind\u0026rdquo;, by Kay Redfield Jamison (great book!)\nNext up from the shelf is: \u0026ldquo;Ten Things I Hate About Me\u0026rdquo;, by Joe Tracini.\nWhat triggered this blog post is that I recently became aware that Dad was once a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He may have mentioned it during a late night ramble\u0026ndash;obviously I ramble too\u0026ndash;I can\u0026rsquo;t recall. To be honest, Dad rarely talked about his physical ailments. So, as I was holding the medallions in my hand (oh, I probably should have mentioned that this is how I found out), I realized that right now I am older than he was when he became a member of AA. He had fused vertebrae that the military decided was not caused by his 20+ years of service working in the various Navy galleys of various large ships traversing the variously large oceans. Did I mention that back problems run in the family? Probably from a hereditary reluctance to \u0026rsquo;take it easy\u0026rsquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve had my fair share of back sprains, but I never needed the aid of alcohol or weed to ease the pain. So my reasons for consuming were more of a combination of pride, stress testing my brain, and mental relief. For those that need cannabis for pain relief you have my sympathy. I have been a strong supporter of legalization since it was first available as a prescription in the states.\nAs a kid I did not attend any military balls. Dad may have catered those events though.\nWhen I smoked cannabis, my mind could wander freely without being vigilantly alert of my surroundings. It was as if some trait from a bygone era that kept me mentally prepared for a rogue cave bear to crash through a window was subdued. After a smoking \u0026lsquo;session\u0026rsquo; of .25g vaporized cannabis, I could move and edit 3D objects in my mind much like I could with 3D software. Visualizing basic stress testing and simulations of those newly mentally constructed objects (mostly simple designs and simulations) was something I could do as well. I have a very untrained visually motivated mind, and visualizing these things while I\u0026rsquo;m sober is completely within the realm of possibility, but the mental images are not as vivid, and it\u0026rsquo;s not something I can do consistently. Another thing of note was a major boost to my self awareness after trying Delta-9 (THC) on my own. For the first time I was able to accurately process how I project my self image, which was eye opening, and was also the source of many headaches. Smoking cannabis is definitely not something I recommend for those with developing brains. I avoided the first opportunity to smoke a joint at the age of 12, and I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that I had the street smarts to pull that off without drawing too much attention to myself. Appealing to the \u0026ldquo;Oh ok, more for me\u0026rdquo; mentality really smooths things over within small concentrated groups.\nBears, beets, Battlestar Galactica.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve found that keeps me from splurging on a janky CBD blunt is using that money to buy a book, Blu-ray, DVD or CD. I also think about how much I coughed after smoking CBD extracts (even when vaporized\u0026ndash;Delta-9 is not legal in my state..). It helps if the media purchased triggers older memories. Like some kind of double purpose reason to spend a little money on entertainment, and possibly reconnect some neural pathways in the process. Nostalgia I suppose is natural for most people in their thirties anyway. My reasoning behind buying tangible media is that I might not remember the triggering moment or the connection of that moment paired to a certain movie (like a Blu-ray copy of Ghostbusters: Afterlife), but I can look at a shelf and see my sobriety represented as a media collection. Which might seem dorky, but I\u0026rsquo;m ok with that.\nDouble Purpose Reason is either a totally for real new dance move or a totally for real new band name.\nWhile these purchases may seem like a redirect of impulse buys (at the moment my underpants are held together by safety pins), if I keep my media purchases inline with only my strongest desires to buy a blunt, or a 48pk (or a handle of something\u0026ndash;I was raised German American), I can avoid going over my entertainment budget. Which I realize for some may be easier said than done. I guess my tolerance never went beyond 1g a day. For that and too many other reasons to list, I am very fortunate. The isometric layout of the situation should make it clear that I\u0026rsquo;m also investing in something for the future. Sure they\u0026rsquo;re just micro investments, but they add up to a tremendous entertainment value.\nIsometric layout is a reference to isometric style video games like Bastion, Path of Exile, and Diablo.\nNext to me is a workstation computer with the added benefit of streaming media rips on the local network (via üîó Jellyfin). That\u0026rsquo;s another factor in my preference for physical media. As soon as it\u0026rsquo;s out of the shipping packaging, I clean the media if it\u0026rsquo;s used, then I rip it to the server. No ads, no subscription costs, and the software never forgets where I left off, because that\u0026rsquo;s a feature of Jellyfin. As a testament of my tendency to be overly prepared for things, the server runs off a very large uninterruptible power supply (~45 minutes of battery life), so temporary power outages are not a problem. I\u0026rsquo;m stoked to have nearly completed the collection of Star Wars Blu-rays. Next up is completing the Studio Ghibli, and Pixar Blu-ray collections (just a few left to collect).\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s wise to look back just to see how far you\u0026rsquo;ve traveled. Plus, gotta catch them all right?\nSince my drug of choice was cannabis, the trade offs were rather low (!\u0026ndash;the trade offs are exponentially worse for adolescents\u0026ndash;!), but the trade offs for adults have a tendency to compound over time. The more memories I developed under the influence, the fewer I could recall while sober. I have a difficult time believing that cannabis is a legitimate cause of memory loss for adults (brain damage). Well, I mean, unless a person is smoking 3g or more a day. At that level of cannabis consumption, the amount of carcinogens being inhaled from the combustion of plant material might be something to consider as well. While I\u0026rsquo;m on the subject of smoking methods, bongs don\u0026rsquo;t filter out the harmful chemicals üîó Healthline.com | Demystifying the Bong), so ah\u0026ndash;well they look pretty anyway. I think something random like working as an A/C mechanic in Florida attics in the summer is more likely to cause memory loss. From my own personal experience, it was difficult for me to retrieve a memory when it was formed while in an altered mental state, unless I was in the same altered mental state while attempting to access that memory. I like to think that my memories were simply misplaced. Like a media remote that for one reason or another moves itself to odd places in the living room (like behind the couch).\nThis metaphorical remote is also my phone, which makes misplacing it even more daunting.\nFor the reasons listed above, and potentially needing to drive somewhere at any moment for any purpose are the reasons why I decided it was time to quit. Not to mention, smoking cannabis for escapism instead of pain relief, or drinking every night, is kind of like putting money in a pile and setting the money on fire. Instead of burning my pile of money, I now have to figure out what shelving to build for all this media that is sure to never go out of style. I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to find an excuss to try out Japanese pull saws, and well cared for shelving would be excuse number two.\nArticles on long term use of cannabis: üîó CDC, üîó NIH, üîó Heathline.com, üîó CNN\n"},{"id":149,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2023/0523/","title":"üìÅ 05-23","parent":"üìÅ 2023","content":" May 4, 2023 May the 4th be with you May 9, 2023 Ready Player Done May 20, 2023 Pull saw May 4, 2023 May the 4th be with you RIP Carrie Fisher\nMay 9, 2023 Ready Player Done Asst to Regional Mgr Dwight Shelford\nWith the assistance of üîó Stable Diffusion I updated the artwork for this website. üîó MC Gremlin (yep, named it) is like a gothic gremlin or something I don\u0026rsquo;t know.

Yep.\nFossil Neutra Gen. 6 Hybrid Smartwatch (FTW7074) *Presses Alexa button* \u0026ldquo;What is Linux?\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the glass of this watch will survive the battery (7000 series glass appears to be üîó Mineral Crystal), but at 14 days per charge I was willing to take that risk. I\u0026rsquo;ve accidentally smacked the watch face against brass door lock strike plates several times and it only has a few scratches. Weak vibe motor though\u0026ndash;I would not recommend this watch for heavy sleepers.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve noticed a few missed opportunities though like battery % via voice command and the blood oxygen sensor seems to be hit or miss. And I haven\u0026rsquo;t researched which weather service backend is used by Alexa (or this version of Alexa). The rain percentage app of the watch consistently under estimates by ~40-50%, and does not understand how to process commands like \u0026ldquo;What is the surf report for St. Augustine?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;What is the wave height for St. Augustine?\u0026rdquo; It may have been a better experience to pair with the Alexa app instead of the Fossil App. It would have been cool to test out some of those neat Alexa skills.\nAs far as receiving notifications from certain apps this Gen. 6 Hybrid seems to perform admirably. Receiving little vibes on my wrist from AutoZen kept my focus on the route a bit more than without. I just wish I could figure out how to switch off MPRIS notifications sent through KDE Connect. Every time I start a video or change songs KDE Connect pushes a notification, and my watch relays that information as a notification. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have this issue with my Pinetime watch running InfiniTime. If I play three albums of songs, I will receive three albums worth of notifications (not including resuming from pause notifications). Also, the watch is not running WearOS, so it\u0026rsquo;s not compatible with Google Play apps built for WearOS. I can see myself checking out the WearOS ecosystem in the future. Lots of interesting apps that would probably be incredible for outdoor adventuring.\nWith all that said it\u0026rsquo;s still a beautiful watch. The estimated 14 day battery life is pretty accurate (e-ink display), and there\u0026rsquo;s no touchscreen to phantom press when it rains or while swimming. And finally I think the Alexa integration is relatively impressive when I take into consideration that I feel like Harold Crick from the movie Stranger Than Fiction while I\u0026rsquo;m wearing the watch.\n"},{"id":151,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2023/0723/","title":"üìÅ 07-23","parent":"üìÅ 2023","content":" July 13, 2023 Suspicious ADD Activities July 26, 2023 Pseudo-ADD July 13, 2023 Suspicious ADD Activities Dude üîó uslurped someone else\u0026rsquo;s proposal. *boom.gif*\nI\u0026rsquo;m half-way through the book \u0026ldquo;Driven To Distraction\u0026rdquo; (published in 2011), and I already feel as though I\u0026rsquo;m reading my own life story. A lot of the book is verbatim dictation from the clients of Edward M. Hallowell, M.D., and John J. Ratey, M.D., which is pretty awesome. From what I understand so far, an ADD diagnosis is a family affair, so it was refreshing to read of behaviors that are identical to my own memories of childhood. And with so many fresh perspectives, \u0026ldquo;Driven To Distraction\u0026rdquo; is almost too refreshing for my brain to handle. What\u0026rsquo;s worse is that I bought three more books about ADD (same two authors). Oh no, look at me, I have too many books to read *Giant Man Baby Noises*\nMy father passed away in 2012, so there\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no way to talk to him about my childhood. In the book \u0026ldquo;Driven To Distraction\u0026rdquo;, fathers of both children and adults diagnosed with ADD were surprised to know that their child actually answered truthfully when they repeated the sentence, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; I felt terrible after all my mischievous moments as a kid, but when I was asked why I did it (whatever it was), I \u0026lsquo;didn\u0026rsquo;t have an answer\u0026rsquo; or an excuse. I never blamed the family doggo or a friend. My answer was either a resigned, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;, or an exasperated, \u0026ldquo;I DON\u0026rsquo;T KNOW!\u0026rdquo; Which was often chased with, \u0026ldquo;You never know do you?\u0026rdquo; Fun times right?\nObviously, there are other symptoms and or behaviors that I would not have associated with ADD that are mentioned in the book. I never considered that certain verbal and written miscommunications could be a symptom of ADD, but I guess that makes sense. When I was younger, it was nearly impossible for me to keep up with taking notes for any of my classes. I\u0026rsquo;d fish out my three holed paper, and start the outlining process as our teacher reached the third bullet point of the topic. By that point, what the teacher said was lost to me as I tried to copy what was already written. Which may resonate with most, but toss in the little detail that I made one to five mistakes per line\u0026ndash;well, I think it\u0026rsquo;s clear why I had a lot of partially completed notes for study time. During my senior year, I was burning through so many mechanical pencil erasers that I had one of those sliding erasers. In community college I remedied this note taking problem by using some of my federal loan money for an RCA Voice Recorder (üîóRP-5010). Finished my first semester with a 3.0 GPA because I would review those recordings after every lecture, I took notes, and I studied those notes. I had 14 credit hours, so I dedicated 28 hours of study time per week. I never finished my A.S. degree for a few different economic reasons which include receiving my loan and small grant three weeks after the semester began. I fear ridicule, and I\u0026rsquo;ve grappled with forming English sentences since I was in high school, so why not create a candid blog? That sounds like a sensible thing to do with my free time.\nActually, speaking of my inability to find the right words and stuff\u0026ndash;at this particular phase of my life, my friendships have regrettably transitioned from friendships to acquaintances. One of the many pitfalls of having ADD is incidentally and or accidentally burning preverbal bridges. I\u0026rsquo;m also 38, and consistently feel like I\u0026rsquo;m 10-20 years behind, so my friendship status is not just because of ADD. There are some natural processes at play too. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m an outlier and most with ADD can maintain friendships, but people with ADD seem to step on their own toes a lot. I have also lost at least one job because I forgot which day I was suppose to work. And for at least two jobs, I simply decided not to go anymore. Which I know is incredibly irresponsible, but at the time I thought I was making the best decision of my life. Even if the jobs I had were \u0026lsquo;just hourly retail jobs\u0026rsquo;, at least I had the means to maintain my independence. The consequence of one of those \u0026lsquo;career\u0026rsquo; decisions resulted in me paying half the rent of a room in an apartment in North Central Florida, while I payed half the rent of a two bedroom apartment in South Florida. I made that \u0026lsquo;career\u0026rsquo; decision the moment I turned off my alarm clock. After the alarm clock was vanquished, I stayed in bed for the entire day, \u0026ldquo;Nope, I\u0026rsquo;m not going in anymore.\u0026rdquo; The panic most people would feel was completely absent from my brain. For a few months after the decision, I felt like I was alive again, and that my possibilities were endless. That feeling changed when I realized that I was out of instant ramen noodles (Top Ramen). While employed, my savings went towards little nuggets of irony, like Payday candy bars, so instant ramen noodles were less of an adapted lifestyle and more of a life necessity. My calves are probably more toned because all of all the üîó muscle spasms I use to experience when I tried to sleep (not enough minerals, calcium, and potassium).\nIn order to offset many of the pitfalls of ADD (unconfirmed), I have logs of everything. When I say everything, I mean, I have a log of my meals that I started in 2017. I could pull up what I ate for lunch on October 13, 2020 (Maruchan without eggs, seitan, or pork loin). I also created a system log/life journal in 2017. I also need some real world tangible control of my schedule, so to the left of this desk is a 38x26in world map, and above that is a 23x17in monthly calendar dry erase board. Before I clean the dry erase board for the next month, I take a photo (snapshot) of the previous month. After the Nextcloud app on my phone syncs photos and videos to my local cloud, I move the image of previous month to a specific folder for future reference. I also have an offline digital calendar (üîó Calcurse) to record completed daily tasks. And I\u0026rsquo;m not kidding, one of those tasks is to remind myself to shower (everyday).\nThe digital calendar I mentioned in the last paragraph (üîó Calcurse) shares a üîó TMUX session with the system log/journal, calorie log, and a few other things. The digital calendar is called Calcurse because it\u0026rsquo;s a calendar that uses the curses TUI framework. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s a calendar accessible from the command line, so it\u0026rsquo;s very portable. I launch the TMUX session by typing the word \u0026lsquo;daily\u0026rsquo; (with help from: üîó tmuxinator) and then I press enter on the keyboard. Since it\u0026rsquo;s a TMUX session, I can access the session through SSH as long as I have access to the home WiFi. I feel that having an easy way to set timers (or reminders) has also helped me in the past. At the moment I use a Fossil Hybrid smartwatch to bark out commands to Alexa¬Æ, \u0026ldquo;set a timer for 5 minutes please\u0026rdquo;, but before that I used my bash script üîó Ghemx to help me with setting reminders/timers. My Ghemx config file still has timers saved for the washer and dryer. Actually, two timers for the washer (I dump the detergent in after the machine fills with water), and one for the dryer. If KDE Connect is configured to send desktop notifications out to an Android device, Ghemx uses notify-send, so those notifications will pass through as well. With KDE Connect notifications enabled via whatever smartwatch app (i.e. Fossil app), it should also push out notifications from Ghemx on to smartwatch screens. Ghemx has pushed notifications out to my PineTime smartwatch and my Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid smartwatch. Now I\u0026rsquo;ll be the first to admit, my Bash language skills are unorthodox, and Ghemx should have been written in Python. Visualizing object oriented languages is not a skill I have access to on command. For example, this very simple password generator Python script that I call üîó passgen took me about 40 hours to write, comment, and debug. Someone well versed in Python could have written a similar script in less than an hour.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot to process recently to say the least. Finding out that I\u0026rsquo;m not actually a terrible person was pretty good news. Also finding out that most of my impulsive decisions have been due to a misunderstanding of how my brain works was comforting as well.\nThanks goes out to the gods and goddesses of technology. Because I would be lost without it (literally lol).\nJuly 26, 2023 Pseudo-ADD Kelly casted confusion\nI love low powered bluetooth radios as much as the next person, but seriously, Fossil could have developed a wonderful watch with an estimated seven day battery life and it would have been so much better. Most of my problems with the FTW 7074 come from bluetooth interference within a few feet away from the phone.\nWith that said, The Fossil Hybrid watch has indirectly helped with voice activated timers. Small productivity boosters to help with daily side hustle tasks. And the rain percentage provided from voice commands appears to be somewhat accurate. I think it\u0026rsquo;s kind of funny that I can\u0026rsquo;t effectively ask for the current illumination or phase of the moon from the watch. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s effectively a water dog watch, so why not have all water dog things like wave height and moon phases? Though now that I think about it, reef surfers would probably break the \u0026lsquo;mineral\u0026rsquo; glass (not sapphire) within a few weeks.\nSince this is a mostly Linux website, KDE Connect does show up in the toggle-able apps to push notifications to the watch, but I\u0026rsquo;ve had to toggle it off for KDE Connect. It was a great for a week when KDE Connect ignored desktop computer üîó MPRIS events. Now with notifications toggled on, KDE Connect will push notifications to my watch regarding each and every YouTube video I watch, or each song that plays from my desktop computer. Which is odd, because I do not receive these notifications on my phone, just my watch.\n"},{"id":152,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2022/0822/","title":"üìÅ 08-22","parent":"üìÅ 2022","content":" August 9, 2022 My wildling side.

Same ones that made fun of me for practicing freestyle tricks on a skateboard (ironically before I learned of Rodney Mullen).\nAs I sat on that storm drain guard rail (probably while wearing my Goosebumps tie dyed t-shirt) one of them smashed an egg on my head. My guess was that the big guy was itching to fight someone, and my leave me alone face was bugging him. So with egg dripping down my face he asked me, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not mad?\u0026rdquo; I responded with a soft but stern, \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo; What they didn\u0026rsquo;t see is me walking back home to take a shower, and my Dad calling my Mom from work so that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t miss a day of school. They didn\u0026rsquo;t bother me much after that.\nThe positive side was that before moving to Gainesville, FL, I had no general sense of modern skateboarding. What I knew came from 1980s how to skateboard books. Kickflip? I knew more about what lived in Florida swamps and fishing than skateboarding. My first deck was actually a Status shop board (~$35). Probably bought it from Play It Again Sports.\nMy first pro model deck. I believe was a 2001 Kerry Getz Habitat board (~$55)\nAugust 11, 2022 The day a soccer goal chose violence My conscious keeps saying the world needs to know, and so here I am again.\nI was wearing a corduroy golf cap (Andy Capp style) turned backwards. It was hot. We were riding bikes on a soccer field (1997). As a former builder of makeshift launch ramps I needed excitement, so I thought riding through a soccer goal would be fun.\nThe soccer goal (mid-left) closest to the fire station was where it happened\nThe first soccer goal on the far left side of the field (not shown) did not have sidebars, and so I didn\u0026rsquo;t inspect the one ahead of where I was going. Obviously, the goal next to the fire station had sidebars (mid height stabilizer bars on each side). One moment I was riding my bike, the next moment I was picking my self off the ground and picking up one of my front teeth at the same time, \u0026ldquo;Hey guys! I lost a tooth!\u0026rdquo; My twelve year old self had lost about six years of time in a few seconds. My voice was reflected this fact. I knew to keep it in a cup of milk, but my concussion made it difficult to convey why that was important. A parent of one of my friends pointed to my hat and said something like, \u0026ldquo;Chris! You\u0026rsquo;re bleeding!\u0026rdquo;\nDefinitely ruined the nice golf hat from a recent birthday. I rinsed my mouth using the faucet on the side of the 20th Ave. fire station (we lived across the street, and yes it was loud), and I chuckled along with the doctor while he stitched me up at the local clinic. The other tooth was removed by a dentist for other reasons when I was in my twenties. Ok, hopefully that\u0026rsquo;s all the storytime I have for a while.\nPhoto of the scar from 2022 (right above the cyclops forehead ridge)\n"},{"id":153,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2023/0823/","title":"üìÅ 08-23","parent":"üìÅ 2023","content":" August 6, 2023 How to peel an orange with a sim card tool August 15, 2023 Vim forever August 17, 2023 Gold Leafed Marmalade August 20, 2023 Brink! the Disney Channel movie Bootlegged Bansky with a Noritsu August 27, 2023 Nerd cred revoked!

And honestly, the sim card tool does most of the work.\n\u0026ldquo;The Girl Who Came Home\u0026rdquo;, is the only book on the 2READ pile that I haven\u0026rsquo;t read already. Pretty sure I read at least 50 of the first series Goosebumps books before 1998. It\u0026rsquo;s all about the embossing tbh.\nJust an ordinary tuna fish sandwich. Nothing to see here. Move along (all with stolen ingredients \u0026hellip; oh no).\nStill zooming along with Kubuntu 23.04 as my main operating system. My side hustle might not make me rich, but it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been interrupted by any technical difficulties. Though it would be irresponsible of me not to mention that 23.04 is NOT a long term release OS, and it is running on a tried and tested Thinkcentre M73 (w/pupgrades). Best case scenario sans running an Nvidia Quadro K620 in 2023 (oof? oof.).\nFossil FTW7074 Hybrid Watch Update:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fine. Pressing the Alexa button and saying, \u0026ldquo;cancel timer\u0026rdquo;, brings me to an nearly inescapable timer app. Which seems very unintuitive for a voice activated watch. The watch also still drops the Bluetooth signal while the phone is less than 3FT away. Possibly caused by my Avantree Oasis bluetooth transmitter. Sometimes making it difficult to set different timers. Yep, ¬µAlexa requires an uplink to a server to function, go figure right?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been secretly working on isolating a ground loop crackle coming from the M73. It travels up the stereo cable from the PC, through the two channel Just Mixer headphone mixer, and through the transmitter to my bluetooth headphones. The obvious choice is to buy a decent sound card, which I will probably do once I open it up the M73 again and see how the PCIE cards are arranged. I figured it\u0026rsquo;s a ground loop issue because I can stop it by placing my hand on the connector housing of the input cable connected to the mixer (hand on mixer make work good). It might just be a bad cable, but in this instance, I have a good excuse to buy a new sound card.\nI know I\u0026rsquo;m caught up in nostalgia hype, and Gen-Z\u0026rsquo;rs are most likely profiting off my youth, but for a few seconds the other day I could imagine what it was like to walk out of the door of the family home in 1997. I could SMELL the open shed of .. bagged beverage cans as well. I guess the wind shifted during my recollection.\nAugust 15, 2023 Vim forever 2017 was my year with Vim, i3wm, Manjaro/Arch Linux. Vim can be seen in the top right window.\nI never knew üîó Bram Moolenaar (creator of üîó Vim). To be fair, I don\u0026rsquo;t get out much, so that could be part of it. Though I can\u0026rsquo;t speak of Moolenaar or of his character, I can say that Vim helped me organize my thoughts in a way I never thought possible. At this point in my late thirties, I\u0026rsquo;m nearly certain I have some form of attention deficit disorder. The major shift in organizing my life began in 2017 once I obtained confidence with Vim. The text editor melted away, and I could do what I wanted to do at the speed I wanted to do it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a spot in my main Tmuxinator config file for a combination life journal and system maintenance log that I type in everyday (created: December 16, 2017 @ 6:13pm). Which was created using Vim, and updated using Vim. All the pet project scripts I\u0026rsquo;ve written since 2017 were created using Vim. It is one of the first programs I install on a new system, and it is the program I miss the most when I\u0026rsquo;m using Vi.\nIf I wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a monster of a visual person, I would be using Vim to type this blog entry. Previewing markup files using Vim was not something I could do comfortably, so hopefully that explains my monstrosity. I have two documents that I edit everyday in Vim, and I will keep using Vim, whether it be from a terminal emulator, Termux, or Linux console.\nI obviously really enjoy his creation, and I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry to have heard of his passing. RIP.\nAugust 17, 2023 Gold Leafed Marmalade I promise to never use AI memes or text for this blog. Bam, done. Pizza time\nMothballed two @csmertx social media accounts recently. The only websites I check anymore are Imgur and Facebook. For the piping hot Star Trek memes of course. And I do my best to avoid the mud thrown in the Red vs. Blue mudslinging match. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot like dodging water balloons on the last day of high school (catapults .. ).\nThe trick is to spot the airborne balloon, and assume it\u0026rsquo;s not full of water..\nAnd I tell you what, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for inexpensive jeans for work that are more durable than certain outdoor brands, look for surplus uniform jeans on Ebay. These sellers inspect, sort, and wash the pants (depending on the seller ofc). Mostly Redkap brand, which are also sold new through Amazon. What makes these jeans better? Industrial grade stitching, extra belt loops, cotton/polyester blend for stretch/cooling, made for strong legs, and have YKK zippers. Some spots included, but who cares? They\u0026rsquo;re work pants.\nAlso, how do people just sit down and have a conversation with a virtual theater of people? Like, they just do that, and it\u0026rsquo;s rad. I envy your ability to sit still long enough to make that happen. With so many words in the US English language, and so many dialects, and it all just rolls off your tongues. It\u0026rsquo;s as easy to you as eating this slice of pizza is to me.\n*unapologetic pineapple chunk noises*\nAugust 20, 2023 Brink! the Disney Channel movie WOOO! YAHOOO!!! YOOOOOOOO!!!! *More RedBull noises*\nZerospin alleyoop soyale. Looking back, it\u0026rsquo;s funny to think how I failed so spectacularly on a suburban flat bar set-up. One of those wiggly Walmart flat bars. Three years before I messed up my ankle, I was zerospining on to to adult picnic tables. If I remember correctly, the trick is a funny way of saying backwards 360. My skates were less like the sleek inline skates designed for cruisin\u0026rsquo; around Venice Beach, and more like a cross between hockey skates and snowboard boots. I mean, there\u0026rsquo;s a reason why skateboarders called us fruitbooters (AKA frootbooters). My skates were: Remz 2004 (beige) with Groundcontrol frames to help keep from smearing wax all over the skatepark (just like the picture above). There\u0026rsquo;s nothing like running up a metal quarter pipe on skates with wax on the wheels. I started with a 1998-2001 model of USD (company) üîó Throne (model) I found for $80 at a local sporting goods reseller.\nThe real crime was the ultra tall green Guinness shirt that I wore to cover my sagging bottom. KFC 3 era üîó Alex Broskow I was not.\nAt the time I was begrudgingly riding a Manco Hornet scooter to work. Which was about as cool as it sounds. When I called the local motorcycle shop and said, \u0026ldquo;Hi, I have a Manco Scooter..\u0026rdquo; I was cut off with an, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m sorry you\u0026rsquo;re driving that hunk of junk around, but please continue.\nTo be fair, I got my damn headlight bulb lol\nSometimes I wonder what people think of that one employee that\u0026rsquo;s moving around using crutches. I mean, working retail is a physically demanding job. People underestimate the amount of 12pk sodas and gallon water jugs being lugged around by the staff. Gallon jugs of water at the time were delivered in boxes of 6 gallons per box. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve unloaded a trailer full of water you start to see the other deliveries with a different perspective. I was that person using crutches for three weeks. I should have been that person using crutches after a full examination and whatever pins or casts or boots may have been required to fix what I screwed up. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of twisting around in the air and landing in strange foot configurations for the trick I was trying to perfect (rolling as fast as possible). Thankfully, during the Thing whatever was causing the strange shifting sensation in my ankle/heal stopped. Actually, during the Thing was when I started experimenting with high doses of CBD. To each their own.\nTheir own what? Boat? Like, a free boat? Ok.\nAnd to be fair, I saw an MTV action sports segment featuring Josh Petty that really sparked my interest in the sport. There were two songs I remember: 1. Mykill Myers - Who Am I, and 2: üîó The Associates - From the Ground Up (The World Famous Beat Junkies - Vol. 2 ft. DJ Rhettmatic). I\u0026rsquo;m nearly certain the Who Am I song was for Petty\u0026rsquo;s part. The other song may have been part of a team promo video I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. MTV was spotlighting a lot of interesting talent just before reality TV took over the network.\nThe insult to injury is knowing I could have stomped around in one of those cool looking medical boots.\n‚ô¨ I keep stomping in my medically prescribed boots ‚ô¨\nAlso, during 2005 I took a still photograph of my eMachines laptop from when I was watching a rollerblading video (Cirque Duh SOL EH? ? \u0026hellip; or B-Unique\u0026rsquo;s Freestyle rolling? idk). How about the corner apartment room with the dual windows and that awesome storm season breeze? I\u0026rsquo;ll admit it, staying in North Central Florida has a few perks.\nBootlegged Bansky with a Noritsu Noritsu Koki QSS-32_33 lab printer/scanner courtesy of üîóMinilab.ca\nI dug around the metadata for the labtop image above (shot with a üîóCanon SLR) and found that I used a üîó Noritsu Koki QSS-32_33 lab printer/scanner to print that image. I took several years of typing classes, and the printing controls were limited to a few clusters of buttons, so correcting and printing was one of those weird things that I could do pretty well. Red/Green/Blue adjustments, brightness adjustments, and contrast adjustments. When paired with an appropriate developer (that I have no info on), the lab was capable of printing within 40-45 minutes depending on the number of photos taken per roll. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember all the details, but IIRC, processing the negatives took around 30 minutes. That is, if whomever loaded the machine taped the leader to the leader card correctly. Lost wedding photos once. That was a fun explanation.\n\u0026ldquo;Ma\u0026rsquo;am, our machine, it ate your memories.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yep, chomped them real good.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Oh sure, here\u0026rsquo;s a CVS giftcard for when you want your negatives to get tangled in the gears of this machine again.\u0026rdquo; *Slaps Machine for Good Measure*\nIIRC, the reason store employees told customers 1 hour to develop and print/scan was due to the volume of rolls. On a typical day we printed about 40 rolls, but for certain days of the year we were printing upwards of 120 rolls. I had to tell people coming in with family photos that they\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait until the next day because property damage insurance photos were piling up behind the developer. I stopped counting hours after I told a customer that the wait would be eight hours. Develop, correct, print, and talked photo lab customers through the envelopes. There were also grad night rushes, and graduation rushes.\nAnd yea, I may have learned to print quick because kids visited the store with their folks, and some people thought it was a good idea to drop off their \u0026lsquo;honeymoon\u0026rsquo; pictures. Is honeymoon the right word for it? Thankfully, I\u0026rsquo;ve blocked those particular images from my mind.\nAugust 27, 2023 Nerd cred revoked! Please try again later. Habaneros should be much hotter. There, I said it, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad I said it.\nThe truth is that I am a happier and healthier person while using cannabis. I still have an occasional drink though (a few times a year). And yes, my glass piece did come with a complimentary pair of Birkenstock Sandals, thank you very much for asking. I suddenly feel the urge to rally against üîó GMOs for some reason. They\u0026rsquo;re a big factor of corn production in the United States - but still - my Birkenstocks have broken through my blood brain barrier. There\u0026rsquo;s no hope for me now. Save yourself..\nA few months after I quit cannabis, I lost my main project contract due to low productivity. Apparently, my performance was not on par with my peers, so they ended my contract a week after I passed a project instruction comprehension quiz. In my defense, we were doing 5-15 minutes of searching per task within 1-2 minutes. But wow that job kept my mind busy like no other.\nThe occasional flashback. I mean, let\u0026rsquo;s be real here, the work I did was for a project that interfaced directly with an everyday people network that used a very ineffective content filtering algorithm. The filtering improved quite a bit after the first year, but that first year was just wild. I thought a billion-dollar company would have that figured out before I signed up, but initiating my first inappropriate content flag during the first week proved that theory was incorrect. Please don\u0026rsquo;t sue this smol blogger. This is not even an actual blog. I don\u0026rsquo;t even generate .xml for RSS feeds, so no üîó Slashdot Effect for me (lol).\nThe non-disclosure agreement I signed forbids me from sharing all the identifying details of the work I did, but I can say I started during a very interesting time in U.S. American history. I learned more about news events during those two years than I had in the previous ten years.\nThe slightly filtered smoke you see trapped in that pipe shown above comes from a hemp plant. I bought another 1/4 pound of dried hemp flower early last month. It\u0026rsquo;s really the only thing legal in the state of Florida that is even remotely close to marijuana. I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned üîó Delta-8 before in previous posts. The main chemical of the hybrid/creativity strain I use is üîó CBG, which is similar to üîó CBD, but different. It\u0026rsquo;s a difference that\u0026rsquo;s difficult to explain. I feel like my dexterity is better with CBG (CBG \u0026amp; 2x Delta-8). Gotta load up on those dexterity points, right?\nKubuntu 23.04 Update: It\u0026rsquo;s still fine. I prefer it over 22.04 for playing Steam games. Still use it on the same system I use for my side hustle. It\u0026rsquo;s fine. Fixing whatever madness breaks out when using KDE settings to save session would be nice polish. In the meantime, I have a üîó Plasma restart script, and a üîó KDE reboot script. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m doing it wrong, I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nAnd before I get thousands of emails in my inbox (lol), yes, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried CBD gummies before. Gummies are just not for me. The üîó gummies container I bought has bright colorful cartoon animals on it - just like candy packaging for kids - what could go wrong, right? Oh no, my anxy uncle vibes are showing huh?\nWhelp, back to getting mildly high and reading Goosebumps books. I have five on the 2read pile, and twenty more in the mail, lol. They\u0026rsquo;re like these little time capsules that can be bought for the price of a Starbucks pumpkin spice cold nitro latte espresso macchiato chai mocha grande.\nTasty microchips That\u0026rsquo;s the antennae needed to track a product inside a retail store.\nI mean, technically speaking, a substance or nanobot assembly squad could replicate an antennae using the blood stream, but even so it would take a strong power source to boost the signal beyond the epidermis. And the blockage caused by the antennae would most likely cause cardiac arrest. So, I guess that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work very well at all.\nAugust 30, 2023 Depression \u0026amp; Loneliness ALL. THE. MONDAYS.\nThe awesome part of owning a brain that loses track of time so often is that I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel depression like other people. I\u0026rsquo;m not even masking, I may feel depressed for maybe a day, and then it just flows out of my brain. When I was 18, and had been out of my folk\u0026rsquo;s house for a few years, depression was a malady that was only for the financially secure. My perspective from that era was formed from friends, conversations on city buses, skating around downtown, newspapers, co-workers, and non-fiction books. People didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to think about depression. I\u0026rsquo;ve been numb to the world for long stretches of time, but I believe that is something entirely different.\nThe heck is Depression? Is that the new pizza place off Slurg St. and Flargatoon Ave.?\nBy 2020 I had spent six years in self-isolation. I\u0026rsquo;ve probably mentioned this in a previous blog post. People were losing their minds after the first month of The Thing. That\u0026rsquo;s when it sort of clicked in my head. Once my anxiety of the neighborhood subsided, I had some thoughts to work through. Trust for me is seeing a neighborhood that is very self-sufficient, and is not likely to resort to fighting over resources. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly sure which neighborhood I was in until 2021. When you\u0026rsquo;re waking up every morning at 5:30am, because it\u0026rsquo;s the typical time for smash and grab home invasions, it\u0026rsquo;s a difficult time to organize thoughts. An attempted murder investigation was conducted in this neighborhood just a few years before The Thing. And a neighbor was arrested for dealing (probably weed). It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to be cautious. Like I said, during 2021 was when I had a moment for introspective. For the first time in years, I could breathe a sigh of relief and know that I was working, and that my brain is just fine.\nThe investigation was over $600 in cash. Seriously.\nCapitulating is not something that comes easy to me. For some it\u0026rsquo;s this grand gesture to continue the game, and for me, it\u0026rsquo;s just tedious and tiresome. To be clear, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about kissing the king\u0026rsquo;s ring and falling into some kind of complicated hierarchy. So yea, obviously when I was younger I had a lot of time-outs, and free time to dedicate towards introspection (reading books was allowed).\nI might kiss a ring for Chicago deep dish with sausage, pepperoni, black olives, and pineapples tho\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to keep the loneliness part of this blog post brief. Yep, I feel it every day. And yea, I would gladly accept help. I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid to admit that I need help. For sure. With that said, I would never want someone to help me in the guise of trying to change me into someone I\u0026rsquo;m not. I am the only me that I will ever be. Also, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that podcasts and reading helps a great deal.\nReading kitschy novels about monsters and wtf \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;GO EAT WORMS!\u0026rdquo; How do I even classify that genre?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something to be said about going to church to help with loneliness. I was raised with Lutheran values, but never attended a sermon as a kid. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve read somewhere that church folks actually live longer because of the unity of the congregations. No doubt there are several hundred studies on the subject. As long as the churches honor human dignity and soulful values, I see no harm in believing in a higher power. When I was working during The Thing, I came across several security cam videos showing difficult to explain supernatural like events. Mists floating through doors, etc. Maybe?\nEvents strong enough to trigger motion detection flood lights\u0026hellip;\nI lean towards a belief that the afterlife is more of an energy transfer. We all hit the ground running in an attempt to assemble ourselves again. Which I realize is sobering and terrifying, but far better than believing that it all just ends. I think there are some layers that scientists may not have observed just yet - is all I\u0026rsquo;m saying.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey boss, can you spare some of your energy essence? I promise I\u0026rsquo;ll give it back\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAnd in the life goal category: 31 Goosebumps books acquired, and 31 more to go. So good\nNot counting the 3 re-issues I bought by mistake :/\n"},{"id":154,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2022/0922/","title":"üìÅ 09-22","parent":"üìÅ 2022","content":" September 1, 2022 RIP Spider-man. You were loved. September 5, 2022 Coup√© de ville September 6, 2022 High school drafting class. This one hurt my psyche quite a bit September 8, 2022 From when I worked at United Tote September 18, 2022 Too ambitious to be a bench warmer September 1, 2022 RIP Spider-man. You were loved. This story required a separate post. Something I had to get out. My first grade bus driver Mr. Savage for whatever reason assigned seating. I was assigned to sit next to a Spider-Man fan. He was in kindergarten. And like most kids do, we got into a few heated discussions about Superman vs. Spider-Man. During one of those arguments I made the kid cry, and Mr. Savage re-assigned me to a new seat. This was around the time my father broke the leaf off a table with his fist, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t try on a pair of shoes before taking off the tags (Vietnam War problem). The kid\u0026ndash;I wish I could remember his name\u0026ndash;for some reason was absent for a few days. Obviously, I felt guilty for being so damn mean. I liked Spider-Man and Superman. I probably would have even liked Aquaman had I known of that superhero. At Shell Elementary school, even though there was an intercom system, some of the news was announced by our teachers. The teacher said that the boy dropped his books as he and his Mom were crossing the road, and his decision to retrieve his books without looking out for traffic ended his life.\nI loved books (still love books). I don\u0026rsquo;t fall into another world as I read fiction like I did before, but I use to be completely immersed in the stories. I mean, in first grade I wasn\u0026rsquo;t reading novels, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t need the pictures to visualize what was happening. We had something in common, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get past the Superman vs. Spider-Man argument. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that he died to make me nicer. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that this tragic event had to happen for my benefit. In my opinion that\u0026rsquo;s completely asinine. However, I did take meaning from what happened. It took a few decades for me to realize that I was not to blame. No one was to blame. It was a tragic accident.\nI feel like I may have made amends as I progressed through to high school and in to the real world. When people spoke to me I listened, and I tried to be as accommodating as possible. In my twenties, as a shift manager at CVS, part of my duty was to shift the direction of shouting customers away from other associates on towards myself. And as everyone knows, when someone has to wait an extended period of time for their medication, they have a lot of frustration to offload. Some of them would thank me for letting them vent. Even though \u0026lsquo;venting\u0026rsquo; consisted of them yelling in my face. It was something I developed over time that took a lot of patience and careful attuning to the issues at hand. I try my best to make things right if possible. And if that means swallowing my pride for a little while, then so be it. I can\u0026rsquo;t let that happen again.\nSeptember 5, 2022 Coup√© de ville I seriously doubt my ole 1985 Caddy is still in service\nI was new to the feeling of driving a floating boat of a Cadillac. I believe I worked truck @ CVS that morning, which meant coming in at 3am and getting off at 3pm. Blessed vinyl extraordinaire along for the ride for some reason. We were driving south on 441 just past GHS, about to take a right on to 16th ave.. Not swerving, but no power steering made it difficult to drive super straight. Blue and red flashed in my rear view mirror. I pull into a Citgo gas station parking space and realized my lights were shining through the Citgo building window, so I turned my headlights off. The people that owned the place were always nice to my friends and I, so at least I could return the favor.\nMr. Officer decided it was DUI time, so he asked me to get out and do some of those perfectly accurate physical sobriety tests. Blessed vinyl extraordinaire asked to speak with Mr. Officer privately. I have no idea what was said between them, but after a few minutes I was given a ticket for driving without headlights, and was told my friend would have to drive home\u0026ndash;which was only several hundred feet away. Had he not been along for the ride, I would have spent at least a few nights in jail (thank you).\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s the end of the story right? I paid the $80 ticket for being a skater type and driving a purple Cadillac while mildly tired, and all was well. Nope. You see, I paid with a check. The check was sent back, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of this until there was a notice in the mail stating that my license was suspended. This was during a time when only money orders were the only acceptable payment method for tickets. Ok, this had to have been a mistake right? My first ticket, and this happens. I hired a lawyer to appear in court and save my bacon. On court day I drove to a Broward County courtroom. Within the first 30 minutes of sitting among an auditorium of people waiting for their mini trials, I watched a young and intelligent man get charged with years of jail for selling a small amount of weed. I was waiting maybe an hour before my turn. I stepped up in front of the judge\u0026ndash;my lawyer took one look at me and said one word, \u0026ldquo;guilty\u0026rdquo;, to the judge. The car was impounded six months previously because it was towed before I could get it fixed. And I paid an additional $350 afterwards because Mr. Officer was being a Mr. Officer.\nI used a cassette tape to stereo plug adapter with my RCA Lyra rd1071 MP3 player to play tunes through the Bose speakers. And wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you know it, the door of the MP3 player battery compartment was held shut with a piece of duct tape. A year earlier the player flew out of my pocket while I was riding my bike up and down 16th avenue. In fact, the road was so steep, one time my Suntour back derailleur derailed itself onto the sidewalk. Anyway, the player was loaded with songs from The White Stripes (Elephant), Boards of Canada (Music has the Right to Children), Dragonforce (Inhuman Rampage), and Ratatat (Ratatat \u0026amp; Classics). Probably more, but back then an SD card only held so many MP3s (1-2GB).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know how many times I\u0026rsquo;ve heard the sentence, \u0026ldquo;Have you ever been arrested before?\u0026rdquo; But I\u0026rsquo;ll take that over another pat down anyday shivers. To be clear, it\u0026rsquo;s been 13 years since my last ticket, my driver\u0026rsquo;s license is in good standing, and I always have proof of insurance. When pulled over in the future, the only thing I\u0026rsquo;ll switch off is my windshield wipers.\nSeptember 6, 2022 High school drafting class. This one hurt my psyche quite a bit Pages of ideas in the local Nextcloud instance tho\nOk, granted, this was about twenty years ago, but I still think about it from time to time. My folks smoked cigarettes to cut through the monotony of the day to day grind. And they smoked in the house, ergo, I smelled like smoke. This was during the period in my life when I moved in with my then girlfriend and her family because Vietnam War reasons. So, at the start of my drafting class, I smelled like smoke. And my drafting teacher assumed I smoked my breakfast before class. She said this to me while confiscating my Tech Deck. I think she meant that I was too skinny, and picked up a bad habit at an early age. She also liked to call me urchin in front of the class. Which basically means street rat or hedgehog. I ate what was available to me, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t smoke cigarettes. But I did like to skate, which I guess was 75% of why she said that.\nAt some point I realized that I was going to get a D in the class if I don\u0026rsquo;t take advantage of the extra credit assignment. She loved to scoff at my work for the rest of the class to take notice, and when I asked what was wrong, she would ignore me and continue to the next student. The extra credit assignment was literally my favorite part of that class, which was to design a vehicle using four wheels powered by a rubber band propeller. We were limited to a sheet of foam board, scissors, and tape/glue. I won\u0026rsquo;t name who my teacher grouped me with (now an architect? idk). He probably never had to use his hands for much, which I should have taken into account before I started the design process. I had seen a few prototype car videos, so I decided to create a curved design for the least amount of wind resistance. And the propeller in a push configuration instead of a pull configuration. It sort of looked like a cross between a delta wing and a prototype sports car. Only with a big rubber band powered propeller on the back.\nOnce the design was finished, I tasked my partner with cutting out all the pieces\u0026ndash;not very neighborly of me. Once completed, I assembled the car, and he complained to our drafting teacher because his hand was sore. He probably thought it would have been the other way around. I had done odd jobs since I was seven, so I had no sense of what others of my age group considered too difficult. Maybe I should have spent less time talking with a friend, and included my partner in the design process. I believe there was a physical line to cross to gain extra credit, and there was a contest to see which vehicle could go the farthest. Our car won (x2 the distance of 2nd place). So, extra credit right? Well, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you know it, the designer and builder of the car did not get the extra credit, and failed that class. Had my teacher listened to my side of the story, would I have been an industrial designer? No, probably not. But still, what hell.\nSeptember 8, 2022 From when I worked at United Tote One of my 2009 United Tote pay stubs\nUnited Tote was/is the parimutuel wagering vendor of Pompano Park, Pompano Beach, Florida. All day yesterday the \u0026ldquo;silly ol\u0026rsquo; Winniee the Poooh\u0026rdquo; part of the The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh theme song played in my head. And so, here\u0026rsquo;s another long winded story. Operators showed up for the early morning shift or for the overnight shift. Technicians worked the overnight shift. As an operator, the start of our day involved double checking the live race card (harness race track). If a horse was scratched\u0026ndash;removed from the race\u0026ndash;then changes needed to be made by an operator, so that no one places an impossible bet. As an operator of the morning shift, we performed a lot of the easy technician duties. If someone punched a screen and cracked it, we were called to replace it. But most of our day was spent changing out rolls of self checkout wagering machine paper. Occasionally, we needed to cancel a stolen ticket, or work with track management to figure out something to do with someone\u0026rsquo;s players club card (VIP card). Cards were stolen, and bets made illegally were cancelled. Technicians knew quite a bit more about the machines, so main board changes and such were left for when the technicians arrived for their shifts.\nThe tough calls were for jammed bills. Those required a key from park employees\nAfter about six months of working in the TOTE room, one of the technicians went on vacation for a month. My boss at the time asked me if I would like to take the overnight tech shift for some overtime. I enjoy learning how things work, and I guess I was good enough at documenting work performed that I was asked to work the extra shifts. At the time, I had very little since my move to South Florida. All my stuff was back in Gainesville, FL, and my last car was probably sold for scrap from one of the impound lots a few months before I moved (Caddy). Ninety hour work weeks were tough, but I needed a car, and had trouble with impulse spending. At the time there was a thriving karaoke culture in South Florida, and was somewhat addictive and expensive. Thirteen years later and I still remember the majority of the lyrics from my songs. Anyway, so I came in as an operator in the morning, and left as a technician the following morning. A little bit of sleep, and back to work again. Unfortunately, my relationship did not survive the overtime opportunity. Actually it was fortunate, because we weren\u0026rsquo;t right for each other. She was lonely, and I was doing my best to save for a car and pay my half of everything. There was a Hungry Howies close by that had that cheeseburger pizza. I quickly realized my favorite fast food pizza place. Later I would learn that their Hawaiian pizza is even better. I grew up with pineapple on ham casserole things.\nHungry Howies cheeseburger pizza or pineapple pizza and HBO.\nOne of the folks that worked directly with the track (TOTE was a permanent vendor) once called me Christopher Robin, because our manager had a tattoo of Eore, and I had a way of of avoiding the trouble that our manager and the other employees got into outside of work. The name of the guy that called me Christopher Robin was Joe. I believe he was an announcer for live race days. He was one of the few people that spoke to me without a condescending tone in his voice. Which I appreciated. Even though the machines were from the late 80s or early 90s, it was the first job in which I felt I was using my natural aptitude. Which was rewarding. The place was kind of depressing though. Termites made it so that entire floors were out of order. Not a lot of smiling faces either. Quite a change from my humble beginnings in Hawthorne/Gainesville, FL. I never placed a wager too, so I was kind of on the outside looking inward.\nSeptember 18, 2022 Too ambitious to be a bench warmer I like to keep a baseball around as a reminder\nThis one is from 1995 (I was 11). Which wasn\u0026rsquo;t that long ago. I have a confession to make. I played two years of little league baseball, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hit the ball. It didn\u0026rsquo;t matter who pitched\u0026ndash;whether or not I crowded the plate or did the opposite\u0026ndash;I was either walked to first base, struck out, or was caught looking at all three strikes. Naturally, when my team was at bat, coach (all of them) put me on the bench. The baseball fields were often next to racquet ball courts (perfect for wall ball), and sometimes playgrounds.\nI probably would have fielded more balls with a boy\u0026rsquo;s sized glove too\nIt was nearly impossible to make me sit on a bench when I was surrounded by so much fun. Our team was up to bat, and I was off the bench on a solo adventure. Was it an all star game? I guess that\u0026rsquo;s not important. Near a small building a few dozen feet away from the bleachers, I hear a voice. It\u0026rsquo;s odd that I would tune in to one voice out of all the yelling coming from proud parents, and random kids playing, but her voice was different. \u0026ldquo;Why wont anyone play with me?!\u0026rdquo; The resignation in her voice combined with the near lack of a southern accent was what really caught my attention. As a kid once with a slight British accent adapted from preschool in Bermuda, I knew what it was like to be an outsider in North Central Florida. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but ask her if she wanted to play catch. \u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t have a glove.\u0026rdquo; I believe she said. A few under hand throws later, and our attention shifted to the pull up bars nearby. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember much other than showing her how to penny drop, because unfortunately, our time was cut short. A man from near the bleachers was calling her name. By the tone of his voice, she was in trouble, and he was most likely a legal guardian. It was obviously time for her to go. I believe she said \u0026ldquo;thank you\u0026rdquo;, and we both went our separate ways.\nHave I seen her since then? I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure, but I\u0026rsquo;m thankful that something good came out of my inability to hit a baseball.\n"},{"id":155,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2023/0923/","title":"üìÅ 09-23","parent":"üìÅ 2023","content":" September 2, 2023 Into the flame, into the fire September 19, 2023 Parasites September 21, 2023 Solo YOLO September 27, 2023 Dosing (Don\u0026rsquo;t try this at home kids) [NSFW?] September 2, 2023 Into the flame, into the fire My apologies for sharing the album cover of Aesop Rock\u0026rsquo;s Skelethon (that Grace track is so dope tho)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a gif of an awesome and totally real cat for consideration\nKubuntu 23.04 on this upgraded Lenovo Thinkcentre M73 has been mostly positive.

They have very little regard for the host, and want only what is best for themselves, because anything less would be inconceivable. Their demands will be heard above the demands of all others at all costs, and they are void of dreams or goals because their needs have already been met. If they were human, they would probably laugh in the face of people that say they\u0026rsquo;ll never retire.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll never retire. When I finally scrape together a ten year domain for this website you can take that last line to the bank.\nCalling someone a parasite is one of the lowest forms of insults. With a simple sentence a person is reduced to the least loved life forms on the planet. Which you might imagine is not fun for the person being called a parasite.\nHave you ever envisioned what it would feel like to succumb to a tick invasion because you lack the dexterity required to pluck them off your skin? Parasites are terribly destructive creatures, and to be called one is enough to send someone down a spiral of self doubt and despair.\nüîó \u0026ldquo;How many vermin get to scurry up the piggy back And burrow in before it lose the personhood to sticky trap?\u0026rdquo; [NSFW]\nWith that said, this desk that I\u0026rsquo;m typing from does not belong to me.

If there was something I could focus on long enough to pull myself out of this, I would.

And at the moment I am in between projects.\nFun Fact: DSL connections can be maintained for hours during certain power outages by using a simple 300W UPS.\nActually, I was looking through old emails yesterday, which kind of gave me the idea for this blog post. In 2010, I applied to Walmart, Toys R Us, CVS, Target, and several other places, and never heard back. At the time I had at least five years of active retail experience, and had only month long gaps in employment. I was employed as a gas station \u0026lsquo;attendant\u0026rsquo;, and I applied to different jobs to pull myself out of working overnights for two years, but nothing came from my efforts.\nFill out the two page job application, and submit.

I think anyone that has browsed my Facebook page would know that I am all for working hard to accomplish a goal. When the goals are inaccessible is when the self doubt really starts to eat away at the smile that interviewers are expecting to see in the first place.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not all bad though. Had I not gone through long term unemployment, I would not have the skills to have deployed this website. I tried Linux Mint in 2013 because I was bored to tears and tired of MS Windows.

I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s the framework for big name CGI tooling (Pixar).\nDuring the first minute of interviews, I\u0026rsquo;ve witnessed an interviewer prop their head up with their hand, fold both arms and legs, and one interviewer casually asked me all the boiler plate worksheet questions without facing me. They were interviewing me for a position at one of the CVS stores I once helped to transition from an Eckerd Drug store to a CVS Pharmacy store. I knew how to do the job lol. One interviewer was ten minutes late to the interview because they decided to chat with a friend instead of interviewing me (\u0026ldquo;Maybe he\u0026rsquo;ll just leave.\u0026rdquo;). Another interviewer smiled sardonically throughout the interview. I guess I was a ridiculous candidate for cleaning snake cages. The only advice handed to me by a friend was to drive for Uber - completely bypassing my personality and recommending a job that would trigger migraines. I mean, I watched friends get jobs from other friends while I was stuck on the sidelines.

Not romantically under the stars though, because I was alone, and a raccoon kept crawling under my chair.\nA little over a decade ago I staid (with permission) in the upper floor of what was once a pet shop slash living space in Chinatown of Toronto. Where many people go to university (or to hospital). The window blinds in the room I used to hide my duffel bag were left open. So when I grabbed my clothes every morning, I saw dozens of people going about their day. The population density didn\u0026rsquo;t really scare me after the initial culture shock. It was one of the few times in my life where I blended in to my environment. Yea, I was a weird white boy in Chinatown, but no one cared. Too many people to care. Besides, I\u0026rsquo;m no üîó Jason Tripitikas lol.\nThought provoking skateboard rides around the city while everyone slept were fun. Raccoons dotted the sidewalks, and were face first in the curbside trash bags just vibing on leftovers from the local restaurants and grocery stores. They also did not care.

One did nothing, while the other converted the audio to mono and added more noise (whoops). I\u0026rsquo;ve also tried switching the USB hub to a dedicated PCIE USB port. All signs point to an over zealous transmitter picking up all kinds of noise within a range of ~100FT. And placing my hand on the Just Mixer only isolates some of the noise momentarily. If I keep my hand on the Just Mixer, some of the louder clicks, whirrs, and pops flow to the headphones.\nI think the transmitter is attempting to send a distress signal out to the mother ship tbh (jk)\nSeptember 27, 2023 Dosing (Don\u0026rsquo;t try this at home kids) [NSFW?] Blur erased the hairs a bit, but they\u0026rsquo;re are on those buds I promise (~4 month to clear the tin)\nSupporting the unified rainbow front since the early 90s.

According to üîó Urban Dictionary, I mean can be pithy, but is usually just an exasperated way of dealing with what life throws at ya. I mean, here I am, writing in this blog right? Anyway, if someone has a problem with \u0026lsquo;i mean\u0026rsquo;, maybe suggest the nearest place where they can replace their very fine Oxford shoes. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s what is making them so irritable.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s all those fish and chips I\u0026rsquo;ve been hearing so much about .. lately.\nAnd seriously, if these \u0026lsquo;I hate I mean\u0026rsquo; types give you trouble for how your game character looks, they\u0026rsquo;re just stuck in a mindset that would take a tragedy to break out of. And even that is not a guarantee. \u0026ldquo;Why me all the time\u0026rdquo; types might never learn from their own mistakes. Which is sort of heartbreaking, but that\u0026rsquo;s just how it is sometimes.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not changing the physical attributes of my IG characters. Those features I spent IRL money on mean a lot to me.\nI will never be a statically minded person, because there\u0026rsquo;s always room for mental growth. Some people see this as a weakness, and that too is somewhat heartbreaking. This is why I tend to say the phrase or idiom: so it goes.\nThis is the way. It is what it is. Them\u0026rsquo;s the breaks. That\u0026rsquo;s how the world works. It\u0026rsquo;s a dog eat dog world out there.\nOctober 11, 2023 Again. ACTION! ADVENTURE! PITS OF DOOOOM!\nShout out to the people that took the time to write me back. I know I haven\u0026rsquo;t been as emotionally available as others, and it meant a lot to me to just have a conversation with you all. Even though I\u0026rsquo;m captain awkward conversation man.\nSeriously, it meant a lot during trying times. Thank you for the boiled egg too.\nAlthough I\u0026rsquo;ve built this website from a template created by someone else, I\u0026rsquo;d like to think that I took a prefabricated home and made it my own. Or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a 3D printed home; I\u0026rsquo;m not too sure on the specifications tbh.\nBy a 3D printed home, I mean (lol) concrete composite homes that are uninhabitable because building codes take eons to update.\nAnd oh boy do video games look pretty in 4K. Didn\u0026rsquo;t think the Quadro P620 paired with a i7-4770 would be enough for games developed with 2004ish graphics (lol). Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s worth it to see colors outside the 80% sRGB range. Not to mention just being able to load a game without needing to drop down to 1080p resolution is neat as well. Something with a few more PCIE lanes, capture card, and 64GB-128GB RAM would be pretty sweet. Ten years of online PC gaming as a real boy and I\u0026rsquo;m thinking an actual gaming PC might be a worthwhile investment. I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to get back into 3D rendering and design, so maybe this will cause a cascade of adventuring. Sure does make those \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t sleep\u0026rdquo; MMORPG grind sessions a lot smoother.\nMMORPG grind sessions of me hopping around like a bunny because someone else noticed they can bypass the character loot animation saving 1 second of time per mob loot by jumping as they loot.

Probably time to upgrade the main SSD beyond 512G. I was watching Ant-Man and a popup appeared telling me that I was running out of storage space. Probably should have Nextcloud on a third SSD. I assumed setting aside a 120GB chunk would be enough to automatically backup all photos and videos from my phone. Two years later and I\u0026rsquo;m using Nextcloud with rsync for $USER space backup. I also use it to backup offline git repos, and everything I compile from source, etc. So yea, whoops.\nduhome=\u0026quot;du -h --threshold=20M --exclude /mnt/Storage \u0026gt; storage.txt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; vim storage.txt\u0026quot;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the Bash alias I use to isolate run-away storage issues. For anyone curious.\nLike I\u0026rsquo;ve said several times before, I have no idea what the traffic is like on this website or these side quest blogs. Imgur use to track views to gifs linked on external pages, but that no longer seems to be the case. I WILL NOT implement Google tracking on this site. If I could get away with it, I\u0026rsquo;d avoid Javascript altogether for faster page loads. Regardless, thank you for reading, and I hope I\u0026rsquo;ve condensed my words down in a way that makes reading this blog pleasant.\nDude, where\u0026rsquo;s you analytics dude?\nAlso added a disclaimer on the index page of this site. I barely drink anymore, partly because I prefer CBG/CBD/THC. To be completely honest, one of my deepest fears is vertigo. Beyond the tipsy point really messes with my balance, which in turn dings my self confidence. So yea, I\u0026rsquo;ll continue to talk about substance abuse and use; though I\u0026rsquo;ll do it in a way that makes it all sound most uncool.

DIE!\nNavy brat signing out ftm.\nOctober 13, 2023 Car for a home Since this blog is all about me feeling that I really have nothing to lose anymore, I may as well talk about what it was like to live out of a car in Florida for a few months. To be clear, I\u0026rsquo;m not proud of any of this. I was just dealing with life in the only way I knew how.\nThe summer of 2009 in South Florida was slightly breezy, but mostly hot. My mobile journey started with a dip in the hot tub of the apartment complex I was evicted from. May as well enjoy a little creature comfort before whatever comes next.\nI placed as much of my stuff into my car as I could, which at first meant I couldn\u0026rsquo;t recline the drivers seat. Palm Beach county was not kind to those sleeping in Walmart parking lots, so after a few days, I had to relocate to the parking lot of the central Walmart of Pompano Beach. This was shortly after being asked \u0026ldquo;Have you ever been arrested before?\u0026rdquo; because I made the grave mistake of falling asleep near a public porta-potty. I rented a motel room once a week to shower and stretch me legs. I think I was \u0026lsquo;on the lamb\u0026rsquo; for a week before I got rid of my record collection so that I could recline the drivers seat. This was also when I remembered that my father taught me how to roll my clothes. Which was important in preventing wrinkles.\nI may have been mistaken, but I thought the trick to living out of your car was to drive until sundown, and find a place to sleep. So that\u0026rsquo;s what I did. I drove from the time I got off (7pm), until sundown. Putting way too much wear on my Honda hatchback with 300K+ miles. Another trick I was so sure of was to keep a food that won\u0026rsquo;t spoil easily in the heat. Dry roasted peanuts for the win right? At least that kept my bowels on a schedule to avoid going into Walmart as much as possible. What I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize was that the salt and the heat was a bad combination.\nSummer in Florida is also the rainy season. Did I mention the car did not have working air conditioning? Converting the A/C system from R22 to R134 kind of slipped my mind during a relationship breakup, and me feeling stranded in a city with very few friends. My second year in a motorist\u0026rsquo;s metropolis and I\u0026rsquo;m sleeping with the windows rolled down in the back of a Walmart parking lot. One stormy night in particular comes to mind. I decided that I needed to roll the windows up, because my stuff was getting wet. Save the stuff at all costs right? Even if it\u0026rsquo;s raining, and breezy, a person generates a lot of heat. And with the windows rolled up, there\u0026rsquo;s no place for that heat to expel. Obviously it was hot and humid, but I thought about the rain causing mold and other issues, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d risk falling asleep with a little discomfort. After a while I stopped sweating. That was my first warning sign. I experienced that several times as an HVAC mechanic, so I should have known better. My breathing was slowing and so was my comprehension of the situation. My eyes closed, and that\u0026rsquo;s when my mind told me to roll down the windows. A quick burst of strength returned when I realized that if I fall asleep, I might never wake up. After that, I only had one incident that resulted from me sleeping with the windows rolled down. All I could assess the next morning was that a stream of liquid went over the window, over my seat-belt, on my lap, and on the seat. At least, this is what I noticed when I woke up. Whatever it was filled the car with the smell of ammonia. Adding to the weekly stink of saving money by not renting a hotel room everyday for $50 a night. One bottle of Febreze later and queue the chemical smell headaches.\nAt first I thought the only people that would talk to me would be the police. I have a hard time thinking I was truly homeless after one person stopped by to talk about picking out the right cardboard box. That conversation was cool, so I was more relaxed for the next conversation. Unfortunately, I said too much. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the person I was talking to was evaluating a mark or not, so I left that parking lot never to return. There was too much of the old neighborhood in my mind to feel safe staying at the parking lot. After all, this was within the time frame of hearing a gun shot ring out as I switched my clothes from a washing machine to a drying machine off the corner of Powerline and Sample. That was a tiny strip mall, and a very loud gun. I think the crime tape was only up for a day; probably an open and shut case.\nSo, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t all. I had found a studio apartment for rent for $650/month, but I was a little short on the deposit. This was also during a time when I was very impulsive with my money, smoked cigarettes, and planning for the future meant thinking about what I\u0026rsquo;ll do on my next day off. If I remember correctly, I\u0026rsquo;d rent a motel room on my days off. Instead of finding another retail parking lot, I actually slept at the parking lot of where I worked. Maybe for a few weeks. I\u0026rsquo;d change my clothes everyday in the drivers seat with a towel draped over my legs. Which wasn\u0026rsquo;t awkward until I was near my co-workers. I tried to keep it all quiet, so no one would know, though I think they figured it out when I started smelling after the first week.\nSo when I say I can sleep anywhere, and that sleeping on a yoga mat on a tile floor was like finding a slice of heaven, this is kind of what I mean. Oh, and I read a bunch of books to pass the time.\nI\u0026rsquo;m starting a petition to rename all vegetarian chicken to Chim\u0026rsquo;kn. Just cuz\nOctober 16, 2023 I\u0026rsquo;ll think of something interesting 2018 photo of a Nintendo DS R4 cart loaded with DSx86 (DOS emulator) running Commander Keen 4: Goodbye Galaxy\nTo be honest, I prefer Commander Keen via Magic DOS and a Razer Kishi controller.\nGASP!\nComputer was down from last night till 4pm today as I hammered away fixing GRUB. It was caused by an honest effort to tidy up a laminated sandwich of partitions. I was within working hours from 8am to 4pm, which is a first for me. Also a first for attempting to fix EFI GRUB. Dozens of successful attempts fixing BIOS GRUB. I would include a link to the notes, but there are none. My solution was to install Kubuntu alongside Kubuntu because I knew the installer would create a GRUB partition detected by the system. Some drive space gained, as well as my sanity.\nHow many chroot attempts are too many? Asking for a friend..\nOctober 19, 2023 The Monte Carlo Method Me, contributing to Open Source projects..\nOver ten years of Linux experience that has amounted to not much other than knowing how to operate and fix a Linux system.\nI used the title specifically because methods are used in writing code, and I\u0026rsquo;ll probably forget the name of the method by the time I publish this blog post. All desire to write C++ as a teenager were wiped clean when I saw the mathematical attunement required for a Computer Science degree. They would have shunted me into the graphics or writing department anyway (lol).\nüîó John Carmack and üîó Quake. I knew I needed to know C++ to make a truly unique Quake mod (1999), but that was about it.\nAnd please don\u0026rsquo;t fear that I\u0026rsquo;ll muck up Linux podcasting. I have no intention of being anywhere I don\u0026rsquo;t belong. This also goes for creating a project worthy of its own Github.\nOpen Source role model I am not.\nThere are so many brighter and more skilled people offering up their free time for Open Source it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense for someone like myself to jump in. Maybe if I was twenty years younger, and more enthusiastic about methods and the social constructs that form around these projects.\nSudo ./constructing_my_own_sandwiches.sh\nEven this website is redundant.

I\u0026rsquo;m not that person anymore. I know why I behaved the way I did, and now I am trying my best to maintain equilibrium. And I don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to deal with any in game atonement. The things I said were at worst were annoying, and at best offered some levity.\nThese freckles on my arms can make things frustrating too. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why tho\nIf I was given a dollar for every time I said, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; as an explanation for my mistakes as a kid, I could have purchased a new four door sudan by my 16th birthday. I was a decent kid though, just impulsive.\nMC Twerp\nInstead of repeating old mistakes, I left global in game chats on the 19th. I wish I had sage advice to those in the same situation, but I don\u0026rsquo;t. I don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers. Not all virtual worlds are the same anyway. What I can say is that I\u0026rsquo;ve had peace of mind for several days now. I believe I\u0026rsquo;m going to chase this feeling for the foreseeable future.\nAlert the media! He left the chats! oh no\nTen years in the same spot. An hour away from the city and friends I once knew. Seven years praying to a god that never answered. Two years sitting in a chair I called a stool because the back broke off. And ten years of agonizing boredom that use to be soothed by showing up to work and doing repetitive things for 7-12 hours.\nEver have a \u0026lsquo;retired\u0026rsquo; U.S. doctor offer you a beer while you\u0026rsquo;re working photo lab?\nI feel like every time I\u0026rsquo;m doing well this type of thing happens. I can\u0026rsquo;t blame the game. It\u0026rsquo;s behaving like it did ten years ago. These things develop a mind of their own eventually. Everyone falling into a pattern created by those that came before them. Thankfully, I now have some self checks to prevent my impulsive side from getting the best of me. Unfortunately, my patience for dealing with video game personas has worn thin in the past ten years.\nThey develop minds that think it\u0026rsquo;s perfectly fine to treat game masters (volunteers) like shit\nNow if you\u0026rsquo;ll excuse me, I have to edit the Jellyfin metadata of seven seasons of Boy Meets World, and some cartoons we watched after the morning news aired at my second middle school.

Jellyfin is accessible, though this /etc/hosts line 127.0.1.1 m73.local is not functioning like it should. So no Nextcoud until I order a new router within the next week.

I really wish I had more data. Some way to backup logs externally to a USB drive or something similar would be helpful too. The only data I have at the moment is speculation. New toy opportunity tho, so that\u0026rsquo;ll be fun.\nTo be honest, a renewed router is not a great starting point for sanity checks.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go into the specifics of the current router for security reasons. What I can say is that the current router does not allow for SSH or Telnet connections. And the current router certainly does not have a dashboard for configuring local static IP addresses. I was using an additional router as a suitable WiFi hotspot for added security, stability, and peace of mind.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah Yes, I would like one slice of mind please.\u0026rdquo;\nAlso, I\u0026rsquo;d like to use this time to disclose my religious, spiritual, and political affiliations.\nPlease reference the following: üîó Star Trek: The Next Generation, and üîó Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\nFuthermore: üîó YouTube | Attic Stein - WONDER PETS THEME SONG REMIX [PROD.

Trent Reznor was one of the newest musical talents to have music videos, Quake the computer game had only been out a few years, and Intel Pentium II \u0026amp; III machines were tossed away in favor of laptops and more portable desktop computers.\nActually, a lot were tossed because the internet was fresh, and lightly dusted with viruses and malware. Good hard disk drives with some years left bogged down by a lot of bad late night decisions. McAfee Stinger was a favorite of mine.

And I was totally and seriously 8 years old. I \u0026lsquo;invented\u0026rsquo; tricks that were invented around the time I was born. Instead of calling one of the tricks a üîótictac, I named it the wiggle worm. For that period in time my favorite album was a coin toss between the Batman Forever Soundtrack and the original Ghostbusters Soundtrack. As proof, there\u0026rsquo;s a few songs from that era in the üîó~/Music/Blog. My original Ghostbusters Soundtrack was on cassette. That\u0026rsquo;s just how bracingly cool I was back then.\nThe Wiggle Worm will forever be my new nickname. You\u0026rsquo;re welcome internet.\nI never mentally grasped how to translate the physics of skateboarding in practice. But I was a participate for fourteen years before work life balance shifted the idea of injuries into the category of irresponsibility. I once did a very shakey 180 ollie down a six stair stairset at the local community college. I should have been a gap skater. I guess I was worried about becoming homeless from paying off hospital bills. A culmination of fourteen years of scrapped knees, elbows, and two busted wrists. There were a few attempts to 180 a seven stair somewhere in Downtown Gainesville (Florida); of course that was thwarted by the local police department.\nThe hoarders of skateboarding secrets scornfully looked on as I tried my best. Nearly certain I incidentally spawned the name of the local skateboard club known as \u0026lsquo;Lurk Nasty\u0026rsquo;. Lots of money was dumped into that endeavour. Hope it worked out for them\u0026ndash;seemed like a lot of fun.\nHundreds of skateboard magazines, dozens of videos, dozens of skateboard decks, and all far too late.\nüîóPro stories often start with rolling around with friends, and sponsors taking notice a few years later\nSkateboarding wasn\u0026rsquo;t a given for me. It\u0026rsquo;s not something I knew would be there when I stepped off the school bus. Some days I would unlock the back door to the house after school, and know I was coming home to a board I snapped yesterday. The first board that snapped was the last straw for my folks. I would sometimes go months without skating after snapping a board. It frustrated me to the point of selling all my video games and consoles to pay for skate decks.\nNES, SNES, üîóDMG Gameboy, Genesis, and my beloved Playstation 1. \u0026ldquo;Oh yah, he\u0026rsquo;s hard on shoes that one.\u0026rdquo;\nIt was something I thought about all day. It was what I was thinking about when I was looking out any window I would find while in class. For the classrooms with few windows, I looked inward instead. I believe one person noticed me looking at my math textbook book on top my uncomfortable desk. My gaze would have been as if the words of the book were 100 yards away. At first, I would try to comprehend the words, but my inner ambitions took over, and off my mind went; imagining how it would feel like to skate around the middle school. Nice new slabs of concrete. The thump of the wheels rolling over each gap in the pavement. And then my oversized pants would wrap up into the wheels, and there I\u0026rsquo;d go, spiraling out of control in my own daydream.\nSkating around my middle school was literally a dream of mine. Shoot for the stars right?\nThe first board break happens simply because learning to land flip tricks exerts a lot of downward force on a glued stack of maple veneer. Oh course, when I did it, I landed in the middle of the board with all my weight on my front foot. I never purposely broke (AKA focused) a skateboard. There was a serious disconnect between what I said, and what my folks believed back then.\nI thought I was mobbing varial flips. What I was actually doing was dolphin flips *shrugs*\nI am now 39 years old, and it still pains me to think of all the fun I could have had, had my folks taken my interest in skateboarding seriously. Of course, this was after two years of carting around my boney self for baseball games and practice, and one eviction, so my story is a little different.\n39 YEARS YOUNG! YOOOOOOO-LO!\nThere was also a knowledge disconnect at the time. My folks were reluctant to believe words on the internet. Whatever they learned about skateboarding outside of conversations with me (unbelievable conversations), where from action sports events like the X-Games. Professionals that land bolts all the time (feet over the axles/trucks). Accidentally breaking a board was inline with the legend of Nessie.\nX-Games \u0026lsquo;street\u0026rsquo; skatepark was more like a skatepark for vert dogs. Daewon Song still rips tho\nAll the magazines, and videos I \u0026lsquo;consumed\u0026rsquo; were of street skating. A form of skateboarding in which there were fewer rules, a chance for handcuffs and an arrest record, but was more accessible to the average skateboarder. This also suited my ADHD temperament. The only skate park within a reasonable distance for a self starter youth was inaccessible, because it was part of a \u0026lsquo;club\u0026rsquo; for the local university. In my town there was a real life chance of handcuffs and jail time for skating at a skatepark while young. That only stopped us until several police officers were called to kick us youths out of the park. I was sixteen, and at that point in time had only been to one other skatepark. A local rented a warehouse behind a Tacobell. The place smelled like a Christmas tree from all the unpainted pine wood, and it was only open for about a year. And at $5-10/day, it was not a place I could go skate at everyday. Flipside Skatepark (owned by Billy Rohan, and possibly Harold Hunter). Technically it was a pile of ramps and flatbar rails there were dragged out onto a tennis court every Thursday night. The local skateshop had a few flatbars for the locals too. Fluid Skateshop \u0026gt; Smoke Skateshop.\nOne time I read and re-read skateboarding magazines while I waited overnight at Toronto Pearson Airport. \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;the [blah blah blah] is for unloading and loading only\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAt sixteen was when I realized skateboarding itself wasn\u0026rsquo;t something I could do as a career. Which was far later in the game than most people my age. I should have known this before I turned twelve. But I kept pushing forward with my obsession. Funds were tight, and there were hundreds of arguments. Had no control over my day dreams in class, and most teachers gave up trying to call my attention back to class after the first semester.\nPoor sporting arguments. Use to envy those that could fall asleep in class. I had a backpack to guard\u0026ndash;couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nThere was a pushing force in the back of my mind that I\u0026rsquo;d later call ADHD that took over at a certain age, and made me realize that an early dream of becoming a Herpetologist was not a realistic goal. And so I pivoted to a dream of joining the U.S. Air Force. The idea of having my body subjected to the torture of flying in a jet was very appealing at the age of eight. It\u0026rsquo;s still one of the reasons I play first person shooter video games. Maps like üîóDM-Morpheus (Unreal Tournament) come to mind\u0026ndash;because flying. I was really excited about the prospect of signing up in ten years, and I guess I was so overeager that my father decided to test my resolve by regurgitating what he heard during basic training (from the early 70s). Since I was decent at catching a baseball, and had an awful batting average, and wasn\u0026rsquo;t capable of wrapping my head around surviving basic training (I would have excelled and learned computer science), my mind fully and totally pivoted to skateboarding. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to skate down Dead Man\u0026rsquo;s Curve one day. I promise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Breh, you\u0026rsquo;re eight years old, how are you even going to survive basic training? Do you even basic training maggot lips?\u0026rdquo; Wait.. what?\nWhen I saw that a new skateboard video review website was taking applications my sophomore year of high school for reviewers, I jumped on the chance. I wrote a three paragraph essay, and got a spot on their üîóreview roster. In a few weeks, a package of bright yellow tapes with handwritten labels were in my hands. With one package shipped free, my skateboard video collection grew by 90%. I was the original Granitesoul. I guess someone got out of jail and decided to bogart that handle while I was busy graduating high school. During the first semester of my senior year of high school I dropped out of reviewing for Skim The Fat (never liked that exclusionary name). I could either drop out of skateboarding, or drop out of high school. At the time I was also a fan of üîóBad Religion (which explains my Skimthefat.com profile picture).\nWhen I was 16 I kickflipped in socks after a kid at our high school said he couldn\u0026rsquo;t skate my board because he wasn\u0026rsquo;t wearing his \u0026lsquo;skate shoes\u0026rsquo;. He also threatened students in one of my middle school classes. I was duty bound to wreck my socks.\nWith all that said, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty good at pretending I\u0026rsquo;m fluent in English.\nPortioning out my weaknesses for the deranged üîópretendy-times since 1997.\nIf someone asked me if I skate today I\u0026rsquo;d say no. I\u0026rsquo;m no longer a skateboarder. That lifestyle drained out of me a long time ago.\nThough I still see skate spots while driving around or watching TV. I can\u0026rsquo;t help it.\nWhile I was still a lifestyle skateboarder at heart, I also started to teach myself table top skateboarding (fingerboarding). Learning how to ollie on a fingerboard accompanied üîó28.8 baud modem sounds. At the time I was also teaching myself Photoshop, HTML, Quake 1 level editing and modding, and how to create Windows 98 sound themes (my brother\u0026rsquo;s partner at the time was thrilled with the new and very custom Beavis and Butthead sound theme). I learned a few tricks while waiting for instructional web pages to load.\nThe most difficult aspect of table top skateboarding is putting on the finger pants and finger shoes tbh. I\u0026rsquo;m one of the few to forego finger elbow and knee pads. I just like to go for it you know? \u0026ldquo;Whaaaaat?!\u0026rdquo; Also, Orcas are üîógnarly.\nFrom outsiders of table top skateboarding, I was a kook. It was also a great past time to separate myself from women that were only interested in my mad wood chopping skills.\nHow many different and unique skills are involved in act of wood chopping? \u0026ldquo;Stay a while, and listen.\u0026rdquo; Probably a lot, I have no idea.\nJust after high school, I had moved out of the apartment I staid at with my high school sweetheart, and her family. I found myself sharing a room with a long time friend, which was pretty cool. I had sent out a digital form of my demo tape to a fingerboard deck company out of Las Vegas, Nevada. This was before I transitioned from using a webcam to a S-VHS camera. I taught myself a little about video montages, and digitizing analog videos too.\n5-0 pivot nosegrind, nollie flip 5-0, and hardflip 5-0 were kind of advanced back then\nI found myself in a community of like minded people. We drilled out a hole in our Tech Deck trucks, slipped in a probably ok single axle, and used a tap and die set to thread the ends. Back then here was a decent amount of elbow grease that went into being able to use a fingerboard for more than thirty minutes without them falling apart. I borrowed my fathers mini manual drill for the job.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you even single axle trucks breh?\u0026rdquo;\nSwitching to working full time, and dating someone that lived in Toronto, Ontario, Canada skidded my pro fingerboarding status to a halt.\nActually *adjusts imaginary glasses*, I filmed a pro level video part, but once I learned the video would be known as Amerikkka, I forfeited my fingerboarding \u0026lsquo;career\u0026rsquo;. I talked to one of the dudes that became a fixture in what is known as the fingerboard community back when he was this big nosed 15 year old working out of his father\u0026rsquo;s garage. I was jealous of his mad skills tbh\nTo be fair, the pay would have been like $2-5 a board. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how it is now, but back then we designed our own board graphics, and the only professional fingerboarding equipment was all manufactured in Germany (~$300 for a complete fingerboard shipped to USA).\nMy design was really, really, bad. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say it was better for all of humanity that I never turned pro. I also included a very üîódissociative (to me) song in one of my contest submission videos. We also made all of our obstacles out of card board, and can-do-attitude scraps of whatever we could find. I made a big stair-set out of stacked, glued, and painted particle board, and a meticulously bent 5mm rod of nickle coated zinc.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s something I do now as a form of meditation. Meditation that involves a hint of practical physics.\n\u0026ldquo;How about a hint of git off your high horse and mix me another cocktail.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Breh, do you even Cosmopolitan?\u0026rdquo;\nAll these monies I\u0026rsquo;m saving from not drinking, binge snacking, energy drinks, or cigarettes has to be put to good use right?\n\u0026ldquo;Breh, how many Starbucks is that fingerboard even worth?\u0026rdquo; Elevendy Starbucks my friends. Elevendy Starbucks.\nThere really was a somewhat logical line of thought involved in joining the world of skateboarding. And it all hinged off the idea that only way to continue my education (Air Force) was off limits.\nMy eight year old self still can\u0026rsquo;t watch Top Gun without thinking about how different my life would have been. If given the chance to go back in time, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t change a thing.\nAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s my story behind the picture of the book I\u0026rsquo;ve included with this blog post.\n\u0026ldquo;Breh, can you even ride down Dead Man\u0026rsquo;s Curve now that you\u0026rsquo;re all grown up?\u0026rdquo; Nope, not even a little bit.\nNovember 24, 2023 Meet: Steve The Lamp This is Steve The Lamp, and as you can see, he really does light the way.\nSteve The Lamp just needs a USB conversion cord, and an RGB LED (smart bulb), and he\u0026rsquo;ll be set.\nAlexa, turn on Steve please.. *Orc-ish chuckles*\nIn other non-Steve The Lamp related news, I may have found the \u0026lsquo;fix\u0026rsquo; for this Avantree Oasis Plus Bluetooth transmitter I have on the desk. You see, under the rectangular non-skid rubber pad are four screws (one in each corner). With the correct plastic spudger it\u0026rsquo;s simple enough to pop the transmitter open. Once the case is open just need to remove the two screws that secure the antenna PCB in place. With that PCB removed, we have access to the micro RF cable connector. Unplug the cable, and tuck it safely away from PCB components. Bluetooth static issue fixed. This idea came to being after reading Amazon reviews for the üîóSennhesier BT T100\u0026ndash;which does not have an external antenna. The antennae increased the range to like a 1/4 acre (0.1 hectares for those across the pond), which is well beyond an acceptable 20-30ft. If I was to order a new one, I\u0026rsquo;d 100% order the Sennheiser tbh.\n\u0026ldquo;Where\u0026rsquo;s the video!?\u0026rdquo; Steve The Lamp is working on it ok? Give him time. His videos are works of art you know.\nNovember 25, 2023 Well, Mr. Pimpkins is worth it ok? Mr. Pimpkins puts on a show\nAlright, hear me out. My idea is a device that looks like an Amazon Echo with a motion detection activated camera. While that is not particularly interesting, what if the motion detector of this device FaceTimes your phone, so you can talk to your cat? In essence, Mr. Pimpkins can learn how to FaceTime you whenever it gets bored or lonely.\nMr. Pimpkins can now meow at you to fill its\u0026rsquo; bowl from miles away! Because like seriously, the bowl is 90% full, and that is unacceptable.\n"},{"id":160,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2023/1223/","title":"üìÅ 12-23","parent":"üìÅ 2023","content":" December 7, 2023 Hifi vs. Lofi December 17, 2023 Loneliness December 22, 2023 Happy Holidays December 25, 2023 To New Beginnings December 7, 2023 Hifi vs. Lofi That Myspace angle tho\nI am a stranger to hifi equipment required for the \u0026lsquo;clarity\u0026rsquo; offered up from üîóFlac. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine that most albums are cut with $20 headphones in mind, so I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what point I\u0026rsquo;m trying to make here. YouTube offers ~128 kbps üîóm4a files that can be converted with some ffmpeg wizardry. That quality seems to be fine for most (~CD quality). I mean, most devices are not equipped with integrated audio capable of anything beyond 192 kbps (lower hifi range iirc).\nIf you find an error in any of this, I recommend yelling about it profusely. That\u0026rsquo;ll show \u0026rsquo;em.\nMight as well make working from home more interesting right?\nThank you üîóDeaDBeeF for the convert CD wav files to 320 kbps mp3s feature\nI never understood this line from TMNT2 (1991): \u0026ldquo;But when I do, I\u0026rsquo;ll dream of something a little thinner.\u0026rdquo; Nah.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what headphones most recording studios deploy for audio engineers, but I believe the term \u0026lsquo;professional studio headphones\u0026rsquo; came from those industry standards. So that leaves me with the thought that \u0026lsquo;professional studio headphones\u0026rsquo; will reveal the album as it was revealed to the audio engineers. And that level of audio fidelity is probably more than enough for my untrained and boisterous ears.\nAir tight Vulcan logic brought to you by India tea, üîóCadbury Dairy Milk, and üîóStouffer\u0026rsquo;s lasagna\nAlso, I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned my Fossil Hybrid e-ink watch in past blog posts. I respectfully do not recommend. What I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed with mine is that the e-ink display refresh leaves artifacts behind from previous frames. A quick 10-15 minute rest in the freezer seems to fix the issue by returning the e-ink display to black. Which is great, but fades back to grey-ish after warming up. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the issue is overheating or a randomly glitchy firmware update. The screen of mine dims in color because most of the artifacts left behind from previous repaints are of the white repaint used to simulate refreshing the screen.\nDa screen.\nSleep tracking for üîóPineTime in 2024? Oh, and my Fossil Hybrid watch face developed an aged look on the e-ink display due to condensation build-up. Not even suitable in shower steam or any steam. Eat and prepare ramen with your opposite hand or something idk.\nBefore freezer \u0026rsquo;treatment\u0026rsquo; and after freezer \u0026rsquo;treatment\u0026rsquo;\nPineTime to the rescue! It\u0026rsquo;s a watch that does a few things (music, notifications, timers, stopwatch, etc.). At the moment the stopwatch works for tracking my time while working. I bought two of them, so technically I have a backup once I unbrick the first one I bought a few years ago (whoops\u0026ndash;switching from WaspOS to IniniTimeOS did not work out as planned). I wish there was a toggle to disable touch controls. It\u0026rsquo;s water resistant, just not functionally sound in the rain (which is why I bought a Fossil Hybrid\u0026ndash;smh). If I could lock out the PineTime screen somehow with a three button press or whatever that would be pretty awesome. Or just to disable to touchscreen. Ghost input will occasionally clear timers and the stopwatch (long arm hairs).\nTo be fair, I\u0026rsquo;m RMA\u0026rsquo;in my Fossil Hybrid for the sake of sleep tracking. And I\u0026rsquo;m not worried about Alexa spying on me, because that feature via the watch is so basic it\u0026rsquo;s barely functional\nOh, and the üîóinverted colors anomaly of my PineTime watch appeared after charging.\nMain screen with PineTimeStyle watch face and inverted colors\nUser menu screen with inverted colors\nDevice settings screen with inverted colors\nNo comment section via Disqus because I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to babysit this website. I may tap into my middle school self and redesign the website off HTML5 though. Browsed the Defcon website a few times the past few days and realized how kooky this site must look to security professionals. Another Git branch, another dive into HTML. Suppose I could dust off Inkscape and work on the site icons too.\nNot that this site has any influence. No delusions of grandeur here. A few OK Computers tho ;)\nDecember 17, 2023 Loneliness \u0026ldquo;Dude, do you even have a table under all those stickers?!\u0026rdquo; This clipboard is one of a handful of my things that survived the past 23 years.\nCurrently waiting on a Japanese copy of one of my favorite albums to ship from Japan. Super stoked to have a copy of those instrumentals as well as the album. As of 2024 all songs posted to the üîómusic blog will accompany a physical album. And to be fair, the one üîóvinyl album I posted was a fluke. I ordered a CD copy and received a vinyl copy. Maybe they were out of CD copies and I got a bonus for being a loyal consumer?\n\u0026ldquo;Breh, do you even purposefully purchase vinyl records?\u0026rdquo; Uh, yes?\nSo yea, I\u0026rsquo;ve been alone for eleven years. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried to strike up a dialog occasionally, but most of my conversations were turned into entertainment value. So now when I think about sending a private message, I see that message being passed around to all their woman friends as a source of stress relief. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;m going out in the world enough to bump into the love of my life or anything. Which brings me to another point\u0026ndash;yes I have, and I wish I hadn\u0026rsquo;t. I thought I knew what love was, but it was never reciprocated in a way that makes me feel ok.\nEntertainment value like what I imagine takes place when a woman receives a \u0026lsquo;dic pic\u0026rsquo;\nFerociously independent is one of the ways of which I describe myself. Group activities were never my strong suit either. Kind of ties into me being terribly independent. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not the way you do it.\u0026rdquo; When I hear that my mind races to find the source of why that was spoken. Are they asserting dominance? Are they factual and desperately logical? Or are they regurgitating something they have heard from a TV show? Couple those thoughts with my financial constraints and there\u0026rsquo;s a decision that must be made. Do I waste valuable resources (calories) on this interaction? Or do I move on and appear like someone that is selfish and disinterested in the group arrangement? Typically I move on and appear like someone that is selfish and uninterested in group conjunctions.\nHeadaches burn away valuable calories as well (years of poor, etc.)\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re probably gay.\u0026rdquo; Nah, I lived in South Florida for two years. If I was gay people would know I was gay. I saw plenty of people living openly, and marveled at their courage. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine being in a relationship that could easily be undone by external forces. In fact, I won\u0026rsquo;t go into detail for the sake of respect for my family, but a relative took his life because he was gay. It\u0026rsquo;s not something I take lightly, and I will viciously defend against bigotry of that nature.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; Yea, because you didn\u0026rsquo;t care enough to know.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s like a warrior monk or something.\u0026rdquo; Nah, I like tearing apart rotisserie chickens far too much to be a monk. I\u0026rsquo;m just a dude looking for someone to share his life with. Someone that would watch me play with my childish fingerboard and smile because she knows I\u0026rsquo;m meditating. Someone that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t rush to my aid at the first sign of provocation or stress. Someone that would fight side by side with me during those meddlesome teenage years of parenthood. I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in joining for the sake of appeasing loneliness.\n#RotisserieChickens4lyfezYo\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s trying to be a rapper.\u0026rdquo; Now this is an interesting one. Actually, it really isn\u0026rsquo;t. This is a montage of white men from suburban environments looking back at their \u0026lsquo;rapper\u0026rsquo; phase and mistaking that for what I\u0026rsquo;m going through. I had to walk and talk a certain way because that was what was expected of me in my environment. When I walked home from school, I was immersed in it. Rappers from that area were forged, without an ounce of baby fat left on them. To walk or talk anyway different would paint a target on my back, and an easy to follow path to the door of the family trailer. Which some pounded on at 2am-3am in the morning looking for a \u0026hellip; lost love. Wearing a tie dye Goosebumps shirt was my only connection to the middle class lifestyle. And I only got away with it because people thought I smoked weed.\nDuring the 7th grade, I switched to a middle school in the city, and my first thought was: \u0026ldquo;My god, they all still have their baby fat.\u0026rdquo;\nI played 21 on a half court with a chain net, because the local boys kept stealing the rope net to get back at me for not joining their gang. Because of them I know what it sounds like to play 21 on a court with a chain net. Sounded like Machinima Jam or something.\nüéµPeople are strange when you\u0026rsquo;re a strangerüéµ\nDecember 22, 2023 Happy Holidays Tetra Pak hugging robot\nNext year I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to keep a positive tone in this blog.\nHoping to put this X270 Thinkpad through some paces via tech certifications too\nRegardless of the somber tones echoed from this blog, 2023 was a great year, and hopefully 2024 will be even better. With that said, hope everyone reading and not reading this blog have happy times this holiday season.\nSteve The Lamp says happy holidays as well ;)\nDecember 25, 2023 To New Beginnings It\u0026rsquo;s like a rough life draft or something\nBusy dealing with a backlog of shows to organize and shift over to Jellyfin at the moment. Thought I would take a break to re-establish my intentions as a person. While I am totally going to watch some old cartoon favorites and read the first edition Goosebumps collection, my thoughts moving forward will only be about the future. No more nods to people from my past that have helped me along but are no longer in my life.\nThank you.\nI need to clear my thoughts and focus on how to get myself out of this mess. An apartment and a dog has been the goal for decades now, and maybe I can make that a reality if I can just let go of the past and focus on the future. Cannabis is taking the back seat at the moment. I\u0026rsquo;m also wearing boots with bootstraps, so maybe those will help.\nMy boots have two bootstraps per boot, which is like pretty sweet for pulling myself up stuff\nI squeaked a few songs in to the music blog without buying the CD mostly due to time constraints. I bought the digital offering because there\u0026rsquo;s no way I\u0026rsquo;d get a CD shipped from the UK in time for the holidays. And btw, I never thought I\u0026rsquo;d have a favorite laptop until I bought the X270. Little did I know it also has a touch screen. So awesome.

At the end of 2020 I stumbled in to some remote contract work. This job required the use of a keyboard, and a lot of typing. Instead of spending time and money on future RSI surgeries, I decided to get an urklenomic keyboard. The problem with the keyboard I bought (aside from the price tag) was that my wrists would go numb after four hours. Not as urklenomic as I\u0026rsquo;d like. The thin sponge wrist rests sold by the company did not help. That\u0026rsquo;s why I made these.\nThe silicone is too soft. I used Ecoflex 00-10 from Smooth-On (commonly used to make shoe insoles), and mixed in some sparkly black mica powder. After about a year the silicone began to flake away from the surface of the wrist rests. Still easier to clean than any other option on the market. Version #2 will be a medium durometer silicone, and the shape of the wrist rests will be less half a fudge brownie and more of a full keyboard sized shape. The plan is to carve the shape (or master) out of walnut. When casting silicone with silicone it\u0026rsquo;s best to use a durometer that\u0026rsquo;s squishier than the mold. Otherwise they\u0026rsquo;ll fuse together. And no, I have no intention of making anything other than tax deductible office products. Maybe fishing lures. Though I\u0026rsquo;d use a biodegradable plastisol instead of silicone for lures.\n"},{"id":181,"href":"/3D_Modeling/FreeCAD/convert_stl_to_step/","title":"üõ†Ô∏è Convert STL to Step","parent":"üõ†Ô∏è FreeCAD","content":"\nEntry added before 2022\nCenter model\nSelect .stl\nSwitch to Part Workbench\nPart \u0026gt; Create shape from mesh\u0026hellip;\nExport \u0026gt; file.step/.stp\n"},{"id":182,"href":"/Blog/stuff/2024/fishing_lures/","title":"üõ†Ô∏è Fishing Lures","parent":"üõ†Ô∏è Projects","content":"\n2018\nPine 2x4, household lacquer, yellow acrylic painted eyes, and brass hardware (I was bored)\nYet to test the wiggle pattern\n"},{"id":183,"href":"/3D_Modeling/Blender/FreeCad_to_Blender/","title":"üõ†Ô∏è FreeCAD to Blender","parent":"üìΩÔ∏è Blender 3D","content":"\nImporting FreeCAD models to Blender Using Blender v2.8 to smooth out FreeCAD models Preferences \u0026gt; Add-ons \u0026gt; Enable Import STL\nAdd Modifier \u0026gt; Edge Split (Generate Category)\nSmooth Shade (Object Menu: Shade Smooth)\n"},{"id":184,"href":"/Blog/stuff/2023/keyboards/","title":"üõ†Ô∏è Keyboard Modeling","parent":"üõ†Ô∏è Projects","content":"\n2016-2017\nStarted with Blender and finished with Fusion 360 (switches and stabilizers from Thingiverse?)\nDeveloped some RSI symptoms as I worked on this pathway\n"},{"id":185,"href":"/Blog/stuff/2023/rpi4console/","title":"üõ†Ô∏è RPi4 Console (2021)","parent":"üõ†Ô∏è Projects","content":"\nPieced together: June 7, 2021\nRPi4 = Raspberry Pi 4\nI wanted a tiny console to check out ARM architecture stuff: Ubuntu/RPi4, and RetroPie/RPi4.\nThis one does not include a parts list because this configuration (power delivery hat/addon) killed the official RPi4 LCD screen.
