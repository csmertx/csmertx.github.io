If so, then this website layout may change again in the future. Super stoked how the collapsible menus look. That was my reasoning behind picking the Geekdocs theme. Also added a spot to share random music hosted on YouTube. As I update my CD collection I\u0026rsquo;ll share more songs. CDs are so much easier to deal with compared to vinyl\u0026ndash;I can\u0026rsquo;t tell the difference between .mp3 and .flac formats anyway. This lil blog is also a way for me to keep my social media accounts and post elsewhere. Wait out the ad-pocalpyse over in this little corner of cyberspace and whatnot.\nJanuary 13, 2023 Legacy WinXP devices via modern PCs A few years ago I built a persistent Arch Linux system to run off a USB drive. I needed a way to connect a VCR2DVD device with drivers only for Windows XP to a modern computer. Why not Windows XP from a USB drive? It boots to Linux, and loads a virtualized copy of Windows XP with physical access to modern USB ports. And now it\u0026rsquo;s time to build the system again (it\u0026rsquo;s not for me). Why not build it and talk about it when it\u0026rsquo;s finished? Extra motivation to document the process and finish it in the next week or two I guess?\nJanuary 14, 2023 A note for Runes of Magic (MMORPG) First of all, if you\u0026rsquo;re unaware of the game I\u0026rsquo;d advise caution. The game was designed to psychologically extract money from people. Welcome to the world of 2009 and free to play video game titles right?\nIt was the beginning of 2013, the world still turned regardless of the trumpeted songs sung by the 2012 end of the world conspiracy theorists. Anyway, most conspiracy theories are just ploys to sell merchandise. I was terrible at navigating, unemployed, and was looking for a way to be more of a team player. I had spent the last three years working at a tiny gas station near i75\u0026ndash;two of those years I worked the overnight shift. As a console player I developed an appreciation for RPGs, which later grew in to an appreciation for MMORPGs (e.g. World of Warcraft). So I went on the hunt for a free to play (F2P) RPG. That\u0026rsquo;s how I found Runes of Magic. Nothing romantic like a friend handing me a physical copy of the game in 2009. Nope, a simple Google search, and within a few hours I was playing the game. I\u0026rsquo;ll skip all the mundane details of the story\u0026ndash;thousands of hours of mundane details.\nIt took me a few attempts to figure things out. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, my first attempt was a disaster. In the first week of playing RoM I was called a nub\u0026ndash;which means a longtime player that still hasn\u0026rsquo;t figured things out\u0026ndash;and I was trolled more times than I can count. On my second attempt, which was probably a year after the first attempt, I had a lot more fun. Sure I hopped around from guild to guild, but it was a great way to talk to a lot of different people (some had characters in nearly every guild). We traded stories, some were of the golden days of RoM, and things were pretty great. I opted not to use a microphone\u0026ndash;all my communication was through typing. At the time that was the fastest way I could communicate. The trouble started when I said something really stupid to an in game friend. She (?) obviously did not appreciate what I said, and that\u0026rsquo;s when the fun sort of stopped. What I said wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily bad, culturally or otherwise, it was more of the context of what I said. I still feel terrible, and wish I could take it back, but that\u0026rsquo;s not how things work. It seemed like every time I logged in people teased her, so I decided it was time for me to leave. I flash sold all of my gear 90-95% off, and deleted every character on all five accounts.\nMoving right along from 2016 to 08-03-2017. Sometime in 2017 I started listening to a lot of Linux podcasts, soaking in all the details I could, but I needed something to keep my hands busy. Why not play Runes of Magic for an hour or two a day while I listen? As long as I wasn\u0026rsquo;t playing 12-16 hours a day it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a big deal right? For the first year or two I kept to myself, and whenever someone offered a guild invite I would reply with \u0026ldquo;nty\u0026rdquo;. All my replies and conversations were in the form of \u0026ldquo;ty\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;nty\u0026rdquo;. I was very cautious, and even ignored duel invites.\nIn 2022 I opened up a bit more, and had some interesting conversations. There were moments in which I thought the past was talking to me about something. Someone would say something that would catch my attention. But who was saying what? I have no idea. By 2022 I no longer recognized any of the character names. There had been a few server merges since 2016, and one merged the U.S. American server with a few servers from across the pond. The auction house price of gear nearly doubled once a year, and the server population decreased dramatically (which is why prices increased). Guilds were disappearing, and the poor souls that had questions in chat were ridiculed for their ignorance. And not just those with questions were ridiculed for their ignorance, some shouts for lower level instances (LFG) were ridiculed for their insolence. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember how many levels I needed to reach lvl 100/100 (dual class system). Was it twenty? Anyway, in October of 2022 RoM ran a festival event which doubled XP/TP rewards for turning in quests (2.5x?). I screencasted my purchase of daily quest reset tickets (with gold not IRL money), and used those tickets to get both sides of my character to 100/100. Since October 2022, I have had a folder with 300GB worth of 1080p screencast footage. It\u0026rsquo;s obvious by my Github activity that I\u0026rsquo;m not a popular guy. I\u0026rsquo;m not the type to rally the troops into battle or whatever. I mean, I attended a single one hour siege war in my four years\u0026ndash;and when I did my merits (SW currency) for siege war upgrades was ignored. Even though I watched all the footage, took notes, and then sliced up individual clips to be strung together later, I doubt I\u0026rsquo;ll have more than 100 views for the video. It feels like I would be wasting everyone\u0026rsquo;s valuable time (including my own). I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I have the heart to even make an honest attempt at finishing that video. I solo\u0026rsquo;d Runes of Magic. That was the idea behind the video\u0026ndash;how I solo\u0026rsquo;d an MMORPG. Anyway, I don\u0026rsquo;t have the patience for that game anymore. At the moment I don\u0026rsquo;t even have the patience to finish editing that video.\nI guess I needed to get this out in the open. To those that were genuine and helpful in the game I wish you the best. I tried to run a character through some daily quests recently and actually posted in world chat, \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t do this.\u0026rdquo; before logging out. I\u0026rsquo;m no longer keeping tabs on the server status through Discord, and I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure I can play another MMORPG. I just can\u0026rsquo;t do it anymore. And now I feel kind silly about posting this blog post. I remember listening to a podcast that dove into The Sims Online community, and what it was like in the moments before they pulled the plug on the server. The last day of Runes of Magic might not be as heartfelt\u0026ndash;probably more like a 20 year high school reunion\u0026ndash;but still, I hope it\u0026rsquo;s a good one.\nJanuary 16, 2023 Less personal posts, and more technical posts Booting Arch Linux off a USB drive with a specific laptop is not going all that well. It\u0026rsquo;s funny how much things change in only a few years. If only I knew what I did two years ago to make it all work. WinXP legacy devices.. Tried Debian stable earlier, and now trying Ubuntu 22.04 Server. If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work I\u0026rsquo;ll look at other options. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep the too much information (TMI) blog posts up, because there\u0026rsquo;s no one to spray me with a garden hose.\nJanuary 17, 2023 Spelling and Grammar I guess it all depends on your perspective. I know I can do better, and I\u0026rsquo;ll try my darndedest. I really want ArchXP to be a thing. How cool would that be? Not cool at all but still. Arch Linux, USB drive, sometime in the next year. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\nFishing and PFAS Eating one wild fish same as month of drinking [PFAS] tainted water: study\nU.S. Fish \u0026amp; Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuges System: ECDMS4Wildlife \u0026amp; Environmental Contaminants Mapper\nThis is why we can\u0026rsquo;t have nice wild caught fish for dinner.\nJanuary 18, 2023 Music Blog Posts Just for fun. Most are from my own collection, and addressing the Samurai Champloo Music Record entry: I just like the music. When I first watched the Samurai Champloo series, I was buying vinyl records from the Definitive Jux record label. Nujabes fit the style of music I was diving in to at the time and really encouraged me in to become a fan of the anime.\nJanuary 19, 2023 Github-Pages Test Added a new bug report for the markdown formatting mess. I also configured Visual Studio Code with Github markdown extension. It\u0026rsquo;ll be a little bit, but I doubt that more than 13 people visit this site, so in theory few will be affected as I break the website in the process. I\u0026rsquo;m just guessing, I have no accurate way to tell who is viewing what on the website. Consistent cloning though, so that\u0026rsquo;s cool.\nGithub-Pages Success I updated the Music Blog with a song from an American band I\u0026rsquo;ve appreciated since the early 00s, and deployment (converting markdown to HTML) failed. Deployments continued to fail until I removed the name of a certain country that just happens to be part of the band name. Post rock? I like guitar sounds. Which reminds me: Ronald Jenkees - Guitar Sound. I guess github-pages also scrapes and analyzes website link titles, because it kept failing until I removed the YouTube link to the song (Death Rides a Horse). I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a fan of the \u0026lsquo;underdogs\u0026rsquo;, so I hope it\u0026rsquo;s clear that I do not support what\u0026rsquo;s happening\u0026ndash;I just didn\u0026rsquo;t expect github-pages to be so selective.\nJanuary 20, 2023 IRL Designs blog Everything is a blog or Vlog these days c\u0026rsquo;mon. I made some stuff in the past two years, so I thought why not include them as well right? Two can be printed (STLs included), one can be casted, and the other can be purchased. RPi4 Console parts list not included because the configuration zapped my official 7in RPi LCD screen. So it goes. The Day \u0026amp; Night title of this blog subsection has little to do with the lyrics of the Kid Cudi song Day \u0026lsquo;N\u0026rsquo; Night. I do like the beat and atmosphere of that song though.\nJanuary 26, 2023 The Tunnel I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a moment to be brutally honest with myself for all the public to see. I have no job. No career. No five year plan. No job references. No letter of recommendation. No vehicle. I\u0026rsquo;m staying in a family member\u0026rsquo;s storage room an hour away from the city I know. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid of parties. I\u0026rsquo;m 38, and I have no friends. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m not as good as a writer as I once thought. What I do have going for me is that I stopped drinking wine and vaping cannabis several months ago, and I don\u0026rsquo;t buy snacks, energy drinks, or fast food. When I worked retail I needed two energy drinks (red bull) a day just to keep up with appearances. Now I drink tea or coffee (when I can afford unroasted beans). I\u0026rsquo;m also making just enough with \u0026lsquo;side hustles\u0026rsquo; to pay my bills. I\u0026rsquo;d like to pursue a career as a cloud architect, though my work history, personality, and reputation say otherwise. There we go, mask off, and neck revealed.\nJanuary 27, 2023 Professionalism I have Visual Studio Code configured with Vim emulation and the markdown renderer set for Github Flavored Markdown (GFM). I guess it\u0026rsquo;s time to start working on the markdown formatting of this website. Probably didn\u0026rsquo;t have to file a bug report, but it\u0026rsquo;s decent practice.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2023/0223/","title":"Blog | 02/23","parent":"2023","content":" February 3, 2023 Markup Quality Assurance February 5, 2023 Blog posts within resolve #2 February 8. 2023 Open hwhat now?

I think I may have 75% of the pages edited and ready to be pushed upstream. I feel like if I don\u0026rsquo;t at least shout into the void, I may go crazy. So if there\u0026rsquo;s ever a wonder as to why I created a blog for a website of little consequence\u0026ndash;well\u0026ndash;there it is.\nFebruary 5, 2023 Blog posts within resolve #2 \u0026ldquo;What good is a phone call, if you are unable to speak?\u0026rdquo;\nI know, creating an issue within my own project and merging my own fix is against the natural order of open source. I\u0026rsquo;m surprised it\u0026rsquo;s even allowed by Microsoft.. err.. Github. Right, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how many pages I have left to edit. I\u0026rsquo;ll dedicate a full day to go over as much as I can, add some links and whatnot, but I can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee that all the niche notes will be current. I have SOME spare time, but not enough to check every command and reinstall every operating system. I mean, by my various gods, attempting to install all the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) systems again would take up an entire 40 hour work week. As would a single Arch Linux, or Slackware system.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, that gif above reminds me of how I feel about dating. Back when The Office (US) first aired, I was in a long distance online relationship. Which is probably way more popular in 2023. It only lasted a year, because I was way too immature for her. Webcams, microphones, text messaging, eating instant ramen to save for flights to Toronto. I learned that I really like snow. I also saw how my hair is suppose to look for the first time. Hard water sure is a thing here in Florida. A lot of firsts happened like riding in a subway car. Ok, time for more page edits. This markup won\u0026rsquo;t format itself.\nFebruary 8. 2023 Open hwhat now? \u0026ldquo;So uh, are you gonna be using this bumper? Ok then, stay safe out there.

Because damn, I put a lot of myself in to this website, it would take a lot to take it all out just for copy pasta. Anyway, off I go again\u0026ndash;sweepin\u0026rsquo; up tea leaves\u0026ndash;making sure the website is as presentable as possible.\nFebruary 11, 2023 The meme-est University of Colorado Boulder: Shining a light on what comes up when you flush\nMore neat stuff added to FFmpeg. The meme wheel keeps turning. Hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ve finished all the housekeeping needed to keep this website floating for a little while longer. It\u0026rsquo;s not the sparkliest of metaphorical boats, but it\u0026rsquo;ll do just fine for now. And about VSCode\u0026ndash;I get it now. A 32in 4K monitor and VSCode with Dracula theme really hits my visual sweet spot.\nFebruary 12, 2023 Now what? Sneak attack 101\nIf I don\u0026rsquo;t install each pending Flatpak update I see in KDE Discover independently, the updates will stall indefinitely. Apps installed as Snaps seem to update automatically, and in my experience, Snaps don\u0026rsquo;t integrate well with notifications. Which is fine for others, but for me there are times when a notification equals a limited time opportunity to earn some money. Also, for some reason I have to RMB and Copy Link Location to visit links from emails viewed with Thunderbird. If I don\u0026rsquo;t copy the link Thunderbird, will open a blank tab in a new Firefox window. It\u0026rsquo;s just.. what happened? I\u0026rsquo;m thinking I may try Debian KDE with backports and some manually compiled software. Wait, did I just describe Linux Mint? Sheesh.\nThe Arch Linux route.. well, there\u0026rsquo;s a reason why I added the Arch Linux restore page to this website. Actually, Arch Linux is the reason I created the page for BorgBackup, and this backup script. Instead of another two year Arch Linux adventure, I\u0026rsquo;d rather go for a hike or step on a skateboard. Sheesh.\nBut seriously, at least on the Linux side I\u0026rsquo;m not pausing updates for weeks at a time just to avoid the Windows 11 update process.\nFebruary 13, 2023 Aliems Hexagonal aliems\nFlipped a vintage keyboard recently. Such a weird commodity. These days a tricked out keyboard sells faster than a rare DVD or video game. And early 2020 was definitely the time to buy cheap vintage mechanical keyboards. Anyway, I have a few extra Linux operating systems on the SSD of the computer I\u0026rsquo;m typing this from. I should at least switch one out for Linux Mint.\nBy the way, the notes I take of Linux Mint or Debian, or whatever operating system that comes next won\u0026rsquo;t be cluttered with a bunch of words. I\u0026rsquo;ve saved these Blog. pages to clutter with a bunch of words instead. This should be obvious by now. Why would anyone need to read some long winded obfuscated explanation of Ranger File Manager, when a few examples and links will do?\nFebruary 14, 2023 It is Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day. Planetes (1999)\nVSCode spell check enabled. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find an extension that rewrites my sentences in to well written sentences, so uh, sorry about that.\nFebruary 19, 2023 Until next time Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen. 2 I was hoping that a new battery, and refreshing the thermal paste/VRAM pads would eventually fix the overheating issue. Now it looks like I\u0026rsquo;ll need to get a new CM246 chipset, and a decent hot air gun specifically for soldering.\nWell, at least I know there is a power issue, and where the excess heat was coming from. So far I\u0026rsquo;ve replaced the CPU/GPU thermal paste with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut paste. When I unplugged/plugged the CMOS battery so that the Thinkpad would roar back to life is when the chipset blew. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it was from cleaning with 99.9% Isopropyl alcohol. And the thermal paste I used is non-conductive.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll get some testing equipment to check all the mosfets. Someone from Lenovo\u0026rsquo;s refurb division (or from one of the refurb divisions) covered the center drain hole with a refurb sticker, and the inside did show evidence of a minor spill. Fingers crossed that ~$250 and some hot air work will bring this $1,200 laptop back to life. I guess my luxurious YouTube career will have to wait *chuckles*.\nThinkpad X1 Extreme Gen. 2 bad battery and good INTEL CM246 chipset\nThinkpad X1 Extreme Gen. 2 blown CM246 chipset\nFebruary 20, 2023 The truth about soldering laptop chipsets Lots of bravado with puffed out chest regarding my soldering prowess. Some engineer decided to play a prank on me and add some components to the bottom of the board underneath the chipset. I\u0026rsquo;m not a surgeon, or a doctor, or someone that knows how to solder all that well, so ah, that\u0026rsquo;s not happening.\nCan\u0026rsquo;t even use a soldering hot plate, and the solder balls under the chip cover the entire chip, so I doubt hot air will work the way I imagined. And since the C THING has brought down prices on laptops due to more people working remotely, a used replacement motherboard is the same price as a Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3. I have some decisions to make, and none of which involve attempting to pour more money in to this very dead laptop.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still not sure whether or not I allowed enough time for the alcohol to dry when I was cleaning up the motherboard in preparation for solder paste. What are the chances of a two year old mosfet going bad? I\u0026rsquo;d imagine a very slim chance. So unless the battery was bad enough to cause the issue, I probably fried the laptop. Thankfully the laptop technically paid for itself before I killed it, so that\u0026rsquo;s nice *chuckles nervously*.\nFebruary 22, 2023 The Swinging Vine Farm I don\u0026rsquo;t have much to say in this entry. Just an excuse to maybe inspire a certain web comic to feature a Swinging Vine Farm. The only comic with the stones to skip the Tarzan motif. We all know a British person could never survive on jungle water. It would be irresponsible to assume otherwise.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t care to receive credit for the idea\u0026ndash;just really want to read the comic\u0026ndash;of a Swinging Vine Farm. Or the inclusion of a Swinging Vine Farm\u0026hellip;\nFebruary 24, 2023 Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut paste I reapplied thermal paste for the server/workstation CPU and GPU, and nothing blew up.\nAlso, this SMBC comic. Sasquatch pee in the water was way better than a Swinging Vine Farm. I seriously doubt this blog influenced that comic strip, but I LOL\u0026rsquo;d, and sharing is caring.\nAlright, that\u0026rsquo;ll do it for a while. Thanks for reading along.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2023/0323/","title":"Blog | 03/23","parent":"2023","content":" March 7, 2023 Coffee at night?

Kev has Jim\u0026rsquo;s back yo\nI posted a song by Ratatat called Seventeen Years in Music Blog for March 2023. I feel like I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to say this, because I\u0026rsquo;ve been an adult since 2003, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t write the song Seventeen Years. The music was created by Ratatat (lyrics by Young Churf). The video was created by a bunch of talented artists. The premise of the video is about rainforest deforestation, habitation destruction, and the effects it has on the planet. Raccoons seem to be globally recognized creatures, so it makes sense they were used in the video instead of Toucan Sam or King Kong.\nI guess I have another story to tell after all. When I was ten I helped Dad build a fenced in area for a garden. Which sounds normal right? Wild animals eat unprotected produce all the time. So, I chopped down all the small crab apple trees required (by myself) with a normal sized axe, cut the trees to length, and then we assembled the fence. I wanted to cut down more trees, because that\u0026rsquo;s fun right? No access to 90s cable TV type boredom. I guess I was posturing during a conversation, so Dad bet me that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t cut down a medium sized oak tree that was way to close to the house. Just a prideful bet.\nNaturally, I woke up early the next morning and spent six hours chopping into that oak tree. Did I mention it was close to the house? What happened next was like a scene out of that show the Beverly Hillbillies. The tree nearly took out the bay window on the side of our double wide mobile home. We lived within biking distance of a pond, and Dad couldn\u0026rsquo;t drive anymore due to reasons, so that was cool.\nThe town was so tiny that the middle school was also a high school (grades 6-12..). The magnet program for that school was agricultural, which included real life cows. Not at a nearby pasture, there was a literal cow pasture attached to the side of the high school. Like, people showed up to class in literal cowboy boots (lots of rattlesnakes in Hawthorne, FL). Instead of this example of a morning announcement: \u0026ldquo;the owner of the blue Corolla left their lights on\u0026rdquo;, morning announcements where more like: \u0026ldquo;the owner of the blue chevy left a shotgun in their gun rack\u0026rdquo;. I went to both types of schools, and the same inflection was used for either announcement.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s my point? I don\u0026rsquo;t have one. Also, I never developed a fear for dentists. That\u0026rsquo;s not it.\nMarch 24, 2023 Goat on a diving board Those darn kids!\nMagnesia Springs was a strange place in the early 90s..\nI can\u0026rsquo;t see myself shilling out this website on Reddit or Imgur. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure I could pull off a post that ends in positive numbers on those websites. My social media presence as a whole is statuesque at best.\nIf it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for a mixture of insanity and a love for this quirky thing known as Linux, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have themed out this site and wrote all these gosh darn notes.\nWith all that said, not one single click from Google searches. I guess my SEO skills are on par with my social media skills.\nI like to build things, cut wood into smaller pieces, and design trinkets for 3D printing. I recently sketched out an existing porch in Blender 3D. The porch steps need handrails, so ah, that\u0026rsquo;ll be fun.\nMarch 29, 2023 Every of the time Sharks of Scranton, PA\nAbout a week ago I traded my busted Thinkpad for a packet of magic legumes. A few days ago a neck tie and a Logitech Streamcam grew out of those very fine legumes. Now if I could only rock the square toed dress shoe that John Krasinski wears in The Office (S07E19 - Garage Sale). I\u0026rsquo;d be the talk of every virtual meeting. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about me, I won\u0026rsquo;t be handing out all my millions though. I learned as a kid that I should only give my money to those in need (or at least someone I\u0026rsquo;m acquainted with IRL), and I\u0026rsquo;ve stuck to that principle ever since. Also social media comments. Can\u0026rsquo;t be giving away all that comment gold right?\nAnyway, I just recently developed a very serious addiction to Skyrim, so I added a note about fixing input lag (keyboard/mouse). Speaking of input lag, there\u0026rsquo;s an Xbox One controller on this desk, but I\u0026rsquo;ll leave the controller input lag testing to the controller experts. I use this controller for sports games like skateboarding, fishing, \u0026amp; racing\u0026ndash;oh and I guess indie games too. I\u0026rsquo;ll also leave the game play and walkthrough details to the very kind and very capable PC/console game Tubers.\nOh, and one more thing. I guess I should include the porch sketch I made via CGI software with a namesake of a certain kitchen appliance. Toaster 3D. The sketch was made just to illustrate what was in my head. Let\u0026rsquo;s call it a project approval sketch (not my porch). I had to relearn the software, so it took about five hours. I\u0026rsquo;m new to pocket holes, Japanese pull saws, and Japanese wood rasps, so this\u0026rsquo;ll be interesting. I won\u0026rsquo;t be posting photos due to privacy concerns. And if the steps have any lateral wiggle, I\u0026rsquo;ll ask a neighbor for a cup of hammer drill and Tapcons to help screw it down. That\u0026rsquo;s what people do right? They ask neighbors for random stuff? When I built the steps I placed pavers under the steps to prevent any Z axis slippage. So if needed I can anchor the steps to the concrete pavers.\nI use to use Tapcon anchors to secure residential A/C condensers to precast concrete pads when I was an HVAC mechanic. And I built a lot of aluminum boxes. Lots of box making in that job. Good god, those tin snipes they showed in The Office (S08E09 - Mrs. California) would have been extremely helpful.

(1993) April 13, 2023 Long term sobriety April 8, 2023 Courage to close one\u0026rsquo;s eyes Totally tonal Toad with his very fine harmonica and red peacoat.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t had a slice of honest to goodness Italian American pizza in many.. well.. let\u0026rsquo;s not make this awkward and just say it\u0026rsquo;s been a minute and leave it at that. All the hype about the new Soup-r Mare-e-o brothers movie reminded me of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! (1989), and the Super Mario Bros. movie (1993). That cartoon and that movie were both cucumbers. Not as bad as those really awful videos of people scaring their cats with zucchinis and cucumbers, but dang. The cartoon Genie of the Lamp wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even grant a plumber a wish without some coin. And what was going on with those power boots from the movie? The Goombas? The fungus amongus? Sheesh.\nWhen my folks first moved to Florida my Mom worked at a local pizza parlor (it was the 80s..), and the daycare center I stayed at was actually just the kids play place at the restaurant. The owners wanted the restaurant to be ultra kid friendly, so there was a kids area to watch cartoons and play with toys. I think there was a small arcade too? My introduction to pizza in the states was pretty tasty.\nI may have some work lined up. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even need the fancy webcam and my overpriced shirt and tie (glad I have them tho). Hopefully some new projects will be in the works soon-ish rather than later-ish. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel or act like myself when I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m not doing my share of the work. It\u0026rsquo;s a weird catch 22 during interviews.\nA guy that once rode his bike 10 miles to work in the Florida heat due to the city buses being unreliable can\u0026rsquo;t get a job he\u0026rsquo;s totally qualified for, because he\u0026rsquo;s ashamed of himself, and that shame shows during his interviews. Whether or not the interviewee reads the mood as shame or not doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. The appearance of shame is the appearance of failure. Or in practical terms: two weeks of training waisted. Why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t they hire a college student? I mean, this gray haired guy doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have community service on his resume. And wow, the places on his resume don\u0026rsquo;t even exist anymore. What\u0026rsquo;s that about? And no references?! Yikes.\nthanks for reading\nApril 10, 2023 Super Mario Bros. (1993) Totally tonal Toad again (Super Mario Bros. 1993)\nYou know, Maddy Myers has a point. I recently read their Polygon article titled: 1993’s Super Mario Bros. is so much better than the new animated movie. While I don\u0026rsquo;t have fond memories of this movie from childhood (I have no idea why I missed it tbh), I see what they mean about making an attempt to create a movie that sparks the imagination. The slimy fungus shown on the sets were humanoid mushrooms that were \u0026lsquo;de-evolved\u0026rsquo; using the equipment funded by King Koopa. And there were several nods to Mario Bros. lore that I must have missed.\nCucumber is not the word I should have used. I grew up watching 60s-90s creature features, including the original run of Godzilla movies. And I really liked the The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! and the Super Mario Bros. movie. They\u0026rsquo;re not cucumbers.\nMaybe the movie left me a little bitter because of what they did to Toad. At least they gave him a harmonica, and some spikes on his peacoat. Not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll ever see the new Super Mario Brothers movie, but I do have a new DVD copy of Super Mario Bros. that I purchased from the Amazon, you know.. for science.\nApril 13, 2023 Long term sobriety Dwight Schrute: The Office - S02E22 - Casino Night | 00:09:18\nProbably about time for me to stop typing in this blog for a little while (hours of editing later). At the time of writing this I\u0026rsquo;m close to the six month mark without cannabis, and I\u0026rsquo;m at the two year mark of only drinking a few times a year. Right now I wish I could take a walk to clear my head, but a walk would just remind me of all the walking to work I did so many years ago. Memories of mopping up my own soggy tracks from in between the aisles of the retail pharmacy. Besides, in this neighborhood there\u0026rsquo;s a chance that a middle aged man wobbling on an electric scooter will whizz by and honk at me before I reach the mailbox\u0026ndash;though now that I think about it, that does sound somewhat entertaining. Also, in case it wasn\u0026rsquo;t annoyingly obvious, I am an introverted white man in my late thirties, so I pull more aggro than most other people in this neighborhood. I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s clear now why a walk would likely compound my issues into a more tightly wound ball of issues.\nPulling aggro is a reference to heavily armored characters in RPG games that attract the boss monster\u0026rsquo;s attention\nAt the moment it\u0026rsquo;s impossible for me to find joy in filming/producing a video or posting a goofy faced photo of myself to social media. I know the extent of my \u0026lsquo;social influence\u0026rsquo;, and I know myself, which is to say that it\u0026rsquo;s not likely to happen anytime soon without the very chemical substances that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to avoid. That and I\u0026rsquo;m worried about more than just myself. When I worked the retail side of a small pharmacy, I dreaded being stuck behind a register. Restacking a few hundred 12 packs of soda was a treat for me, because it kept me away from the registers. I bet no one could figure out why I wanted to reorganize shelves in the backroom. Climb the 8ft ladder to grab something from loft storage? Yep, on it.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s clear that I\u0026rsquo;m a behind the scenes type of person. This is something I learned about myself right after grade school.\nAs a person that has gone through a metaphorical tunnel filled with people that behave like vampires and zombies, it\u0026rsquo;s a real blow to my morale when I have seen the light at the end of the tunnel, and people have the mental wherewithal to say that the light is actually a train hurtling towards me. I see the utility of this train of thought (snort), but damn. I mean\u0026ndash;I had to wear vampire and zombie costumes to blend in well enough to reach the areas to climb high enough to see the light in the first place. I think the assumption is that this is a typical train tunnel, with trains chugging along on time hauling cargo and or people. The only train I\u0026rsquo;ve rode in Florida reminds me of the very nice train from the movie/book Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. In this particular metaphorical tunnel, the engineers have retired, the trains have been decommissioned and sent to museums or moved to another state. There\u0026rsquo;s also mounds of debris that one has to climb. And believe me, if a train was coming towards me, I\u0026rsquo;d have my worm hooks ready for me to hitch a ride out (partially joking).\nThe part about the train tunnel written above was inspired by the book \u0026ldquo;An Unquiet Mind\u0026rdquo;, by Kay Redfield Jamison (great book!)\nNext up from the shelf is: \u0026ldquo;Ten Things I Hate About Me\u0026rdquo;, by Joe Tracini.\nWhat triggered this blog post is that I recently became aware that Dad was once a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He may have mentioned it during a late night ramble\u0026ndash;obviously I ramble too\u0026ndash;I can\u0026rsquo;t recall. To be honest, Dad rarely talked about his physical ailments. So, as I was holding the medallions in my hand (oh, I probably should have mentioned that this is how I found out), I realized that right now I am older than he was when he became a member of AA. He had fused vertebrae that the military decided was not caused by his 20+ years of service working in the various Navy galleys of various large ships traversing the variously large oceans. Did I mention that back problems run in the family? Probably from a hereditary reluctance to \u0026rsquo;take it easy\u0026rsquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve had my fair share of back sprains, but I never needed the aid of alcohol or weed to ease the pain. So my reasons for consuming were more of a combination of pride, stress testing my brain, and mental relief. For those that need cannabis for pain relief you have my sympathy. I have been a strong supporter of legalization since it was first available as a prescription in the states.\nAs a kid I did not attend any military balls. Dad may have catered those events though.\nWhen I smoked cannabis, my mind could wander freely without being vigilantly alert of my surroundings. It was as if some trait from a bygone era that kept me mentally prepared for a rogue cave bear to crash through a window was subdued. After a smoking \u0026lsquo;session\u0026rsquo; of .25g vaporized cannabis, I could move and edit 3D objects in my mind much like I could with 3D software. Visualizing basic stress testing and simulations of those newly mentally constructed objects (mostly simple designs and simulations) was something I could do as well. I have a very untrained visually motivated mind, and visualizing these things while I\u0026rsquo;m sober is completely within the realm of possibility, but the mental images are not as vivid, and it\u0026rsquo;s not something I can do consistently. Another thing of note was a major boost to my self awareness after trying Delta-9 (THC) on my own. For the first time I was able to accurately process how I project my self image, which was eye opening, and was also the source of many headaches. Smoking cannabis is definitely not something I recommend for those with developing brains. I avoided the first opportunity to smoke a joint at the age of 12, and I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that I had the street smarts to pull that off without drawing too much attention to myself. Appealing to the \u0026ldquo;Oh ok, more for me\u0026rdquo; mentality really smooths things over within small concentrated groups.\nBears, beets, Battlestar Galactica.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve found that keeps me from splurging on a janky CBD blunt is using that money to buy a book, Blu-ray, DVD or CD. I also think about how much I coughed after smoking CBD extracts (even when vaporized\u0026ndash;Delta-9 is not legal in my state..). It helps if the media purchased triggers older memories. Like some kind of double purpose reason to spend a little money on entertainment, and possibly reconnect some neural pathways in the process. Nostalgia I suppose is natural for most people in their thirties anyway. My reasoning behind buying tangible media is that I might not remember the triggering moment or the connection of that moment paired to a certain movie (like a Blu-ray copy of Ghostbusters: Afterlife), but I can look at a shelf and see my sobriety represented as a media collection. Which might seem dorky, but I\u0026rsquo;m ok with that.\nDouble Purpose Reason is either a totally for real new dance move or a totally for real new band name.\nWhile these purchases may seem like a redirect of impulse buys (at the moment my underpants are held together by safety pins), if I keep my media purchases inline with only my strongest desires to buy a blunt, or a 48pk (or a handle of something\u0026ndash;I was raised German American), I can avoid going over my entertainment budget. Which I realize for some may be easier said than done. I guess my tolerance never went beyond 1g a day. For that and too many other reasons to list, I am very fortunate. The isometric layout of the situation should make it clear that I\u0026rsquo;m also investing in something for the future. Sure they\u0026rsquo;re just micro investments, but they add up to a tremendous entertainment value.\nIsometric layout is a reference to isometric style video games like Bastion, Path of Exile, and Diablo.\nNext to me is a workstation computer with the added benefit of streaming media rips on the local network (via Jellyfin). That\u0026rsquo;s another factor in my preference for physical media. As soon as it\u0026rsquo;s out of the shipping packaging, I clean the media if it\u0026rsquo;s used, then I rip it to the server. No ads, no subscription costs, and the software never forgets where I left off, because that\u0026rsquo;s a feature of Jellyfin. As a testament of my tendency to be overly prepared for things, the server runs off a very large uninterruptible power supply (~45 minutes of battery life), so temporary power outages are not a problem. I\u0026rsquo;m stoked to have nearly completed the collection of Star Wars Blu-rays. Next up is completing the Studio Ghibli, and Pixar Blu-ray collections (just a few left to collect).\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s wise to look back just to see how far you\u0026rsquo;ve traveled. Plus, gotta catch them all right?\nSince my drug of choice was cannabis, the trade offs were rather low (!\u0026ndash;the trade offs are exponentially worse for adolescents\u0026ndash;!), but the trade offs for adults have a tendency to compound over time. The more memories I developed under the influence, the fewer I could recall while sober. I have a difficult time believing that cannabis is a legitimate cause of memory loss for adults (brain damage). Well, I mean, unless a person is smoking 3g or more a day. At that level of cannabis consumption, the amount of carcinogens being inhaled from the combustion of plant material might be something to consider as well. While I\u0026rsquo;m on the subject of smoking methods, bongs don\u0026rsquo;t filter out the harmful chemicals (Healthline.com | Demystifying the Bong), so ah\u0026ndash;well they look pretty anyway. I think something random like working as an A/C mechanic in Florida attics in the summer is more likely to cause memory loss. From my own personal experience, it was difficult for me to retrieve a memory when it was formed while in an altered mental state, unless I was in the same altered mental state while attempting to access that memory. I like to think that my memories were simply misplaced. Like a media remote that for one reason or another moves itself to odd places in the living room (like behind the couch).\nThis metaphorical remote is also my phone, which makes misplacing it even more daunting.\nFor the reasons listed above, and potentially needing to drive somewhere at any moment for any purpose are the reasons why I decided it was time to quit. Not to mention, smoking cannabis for escapism instead of pain relief, or drinking every night, is kind of like putting money in a pile and setting the money on fire. Instead of burning my pile of money, I now have to figure out what shelving to build for all this media that is sure to never go out of style. I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to find an excuss to try out Japanese pull saws, and well cared for shelving would be excuse number two.\nArticles on long term use of cannabis: CDC, NIH, Heathline.com, CNN\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2023/0523/","title":"Blog | 05/23","parent":"2023","content":" May 4, 2023 May the 4th be with you May 9, 2023 Ready Player Done May 20, 2023 Pull saw May 4, 2023 May the 4th be with you RIP Carrie Fisher\nMay 9, 2023 Ready Player Done Asst to Regional Mgr Dwight Shelford\nWith the assistance of Stable Diffusion I updated the artwork for this website.

On the plus side, I can now use my Jelly Comb glass touchpad again and one of the Windows games I play doesn\u0026rsquo;t crash when I tab out of it. Yep.\nFossil Neutra Gen. 6 Hybrid Smartwatch (FTW7074) *Presses Alexa button* \u0026ldquo;What is Linux?\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the glass of this watch will survive the battery (7000 series glass appears to be Mineral Crystal), but at 14 days per charge I was willing to take that risk. I\u0026rsquo;ve accidentally smacked the watch face against brass door lock strike plates several times and it only has a few scratches. Weak vibe motor though\u0026ndash;I would not recommend this watch for heavy sleepers.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve noticed a few missed opportunities though like battery % via voice command and the blood oxygen sensor seems to be hit or miss. And I haven\u0026rsquo;t researched which weather service backend is used by Alexa (or this version of Alexa). The rain percentage app of the watch consistently under estimates by ~40-50%, and does not understand how to process commands like \u0026ldquo;What is the surf report for St. Augustine?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;What is the wave height for St. Augustine?\u0026rdquo; It may have been a better experience to pair with the Alexa app instead of the Fossil App. It would have been cool to test out some of those neat Alexa skills.\nAs far as receiving notifications from certain apps this Gen. 6 Hybrid seems to perform admirably. Receiving little vibes on my wrist from AutoZen kept my focus on the route a bit more than without. I just wish I could figure out how to switch off MPRIS notifications sent through KDE Connect. Every time I start a video or change songs KDE Connect pushes a notification, and my watch relays that information as a notification. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have this issue with my Pinetime watch running InfiniTime. If I play three albums of songs, I will receive three albums worth of notifications (not including resuming from pause notifications). Also, the watch is not running WearOS, so it\u0026rsquo;s not compatible with Google Play apps built for WearOS. I can see myself checking out the WearOS ecosystem in the future. Lots of interesting apps that would probably be incredible for outdoor adventuring.\nWith all that said it\u0026rsquo;s still a beautiful watch. The estimated 14 day battery life is pretty accurate (e-ink display), and there\u0026rsquo;s no touchscreen to phantom press when it rains or while swimming. And finally I think the Alexa integration is relatively impressive when I take into consideration that I feel like Harold Crick from the movie Stranger Than Fiction while I\u0026rsquo;m wearing the watch.\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2023/0723/","title":"Blog | 07/23","parent":"2023","content":" July 13, 2023 Suspicious ADD Activities July 26, 2023 Pseudo-ADD July 13, 2023 Suspicious ADD Activities Dude uslurped someone else\u0026rsquo;s proposal. *boom.gif*\nI\u0026rsquo;m half-way through the book \u0026ldquo;Driven To Distraction\u0026rdquo; (published in 2011), and I already feel as though I\u0026rsquo;m reading my own life story. A lot of the book is verbatim dictation from the clients of Edward M. Hallowell, M.D., and John J. Ratey, M.D., which is pretty awesome. From what I understand so far, an ADD diagnosis is a family affair, so it was refreshing to read of behaviors that are identical to my own memories of childhood. And with so many fresh perspectives, \u0026ldquo;Driven To Distraction\u0026rdquo; is almost too refreshing for my brain to handle. What\u0026rsquo;s worse is that I bought three more books about ADD (same two authors). Oh no, look at me, I have too many books to read *Giant Man Baby Noises*\nMy father passed away in 2012, so there\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no way to talk to him about my childhood. In the book \u0026ldquo;Driven To Distraction\u0026rdquo;, fathers of both children and adults diagnosed with ADD were surprised to know that their child actually answered truthfully when they repeated the sentence, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; I felt terrible after all my mischievous moments as a kid, but when I was asked why I did it (whatever it was), I \u0026lsquo;didn\u0026rsquo;t have an answer\u0026rsquo; or an excuse. I never blamed the family doggo or a friend. My answer was either a resigned, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;, or an exasperated, \u0026ldquo;I DON\u0026rsquo;T KNOW!\u0026rdquo; Which was often chased with, \u0026ldquo;You never know do you?\u0026rdquo; Fun times right?\nObviously, there are other symptoms and or behaviors that I would not have associated with ADD that are mentioned in the book. I never considered that certain verbal and written miscommunications could be a symptom of ADD, but I guess that makes sense. When I was younger, it was nearly impossible for me to keep up with taking notes for any of my classes. I\u0026rsquo;d fish out my three holed paper, and start the outlining process as our teacher reached the third bullet point of the topic. By that point, what the teacher said was lost to me as I tried to copy what was already written. Which may resonate with most, but toss in the little detail that I made one to five mistakes per line\u0026ndash;well, I think it\u0026rsquo;s clear why I had a lot of partially completed notes for study time. During my senior year, I was burning through so many mechanical pencil erasers that I had one of those sliding erasers. In community college I remedied this note taking problem by using some of my federal loan money for a Olympus digital voice recorder. I finished my first semester with a 3.0 GPA because I would review those recordings after every lecture, I took notes, and I studied those notes. I had 14 credit hours, so I dedicated 28 hours of study time per week. I never finished my A.S. degree for a few different economic reasons which include receiving my loan and small grant three weeks after the semester began. I fear ridicule, and I\u0026rsquo;ve grappled with forming English sentences since I was in high school, so why not create a candid blog? That sounds like a sensible thing to do with my free time.\nActually, speaking of my inability to find the right words and stuff\u0026ndash;at this particular phase of my life, my friendships have regrettably transitioned from friendships to acquaintances. One of the many pitfalls of having ADD is incidentally and or accidentally burning preverbal bridges. I\u0026rsquo;m also 38, and consistently feel like I\u0026rsquo;m 10-20 years behind, so my friendship status is not just because of ADD. There are some natural processes at play too. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m an outlier and most with ADD can maintain friendships, but people with ADD seem to step on their own toes a lot. I have also lost at least one job because I forgot which day I was suppose to work. And for at least two jobs, I simply decided not to go anymore. Which I know is incredibly irresponsible, but at the time I thought I was making the best decision of my life. Even if the jobs I had were \u0026lsquo;just hourly retail jobs\u0026rsquo;, at least I had the means to maintain my independence. The consequence of one of those \u0026lsquo;career\u0026rsquo; decisions resulted in me paying half the rent of a room in an apartment in North Central Florida, while I payed half the rent of a two bedroom apartment in South Florida. I made that \u0026lsquo;career\u0026rsquo; decision the moment I turned off my alarm clock. After the alarm clock was vanquished, I stayed in bed for the entire day, \u0026ldquo;Nope, I\u0026rsquo;m not going in anymore.\u0026rdquo; The panic most people would feel was completely absent from my brain. For a few months after the decision, I felt like I was alive again, and that my possibilities were endless. That feeling changed when I realized that I was out of instant ramen noodles (Top Ramen). While employed, my savings went towards little nuggets of irony, like Payday candy bars, so instant ramen noodles were less of an adapted lifestyle and more of a life necessity. My calves are probably more toned because all of all the muscle spasms I use to experience when I tried to sleep (not enough minerals, calcium, and potassium).\nIn order to offset many of the pitfalls of ADD (unconfirmed), I have logs of everything. When I say everything, I mean, I have a log of my meals that I started in 2017. I could pull up what I ate for lunch on October 13, 2020 (Maruchan without eggs, seitan, or pork loin). I also created a system log/life journal in 2017. I also need some real world tangible control of my schedule, so to the left of this desk is a 38x26in world map, and above that is a 23x17in monthly calendar dry erase board. Before I clean the dry erase board for the next month, I take a photo (snapshot) of the previous month. After the Nextcloud app on my phone syncs photos and videos to my local cloud, I move the image of previous month to a specific folder for future reference. I also have an offline digital calendar (Calcurse) to record completed daily tasks. And I\u0026rsquo;m not kidding, one of those tasks is to remind myself to shower (everyday).\nThe digital calendar I mentioned in the last paragraph (Calcurse) shares a TMUX session with the system log/journal, calorie log, and a few other things. The digital calendar is called Calcurse because it\u0026rsquo;s a calendar that uses the curses TUI framework. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s a calendar accessible from the command line, so it\u0026rsquo;s very portable. I launch the TMUX session by typing the word \u0026lsquo;daily\u0026rsquo; (with help from: tmuxinator) and then I press enter on the keyboard. Since it\u0026rsquo;s a TMUX session, I can access the session through SSH as long as I have access to the home WiFi. I feel that having an easy way to set timers (or reminders) has also helped me in the past. At the moment I use a Fossil Hybrid smartwatch to bark out commands to Alexa®, \u0026ldquo;set a timer for 5 minutes please\u0026rdquo;, but before that I used my bash script Ghemx to help me with setting reminders/timers. My Ghemx config file still has timers saved for the washer and dryer. Actually, two timers for the washer (I dump the detergent in after the machine fills with water), and one for the dryer. If KDE Connect is configured to send desktop notifications out to an Android device, Ghemx uses notify-send, so those notifications will pass through as well. With KDE Connect notifications enabled via whatever smartwatch app (i.e. Fossil app), it should also push out notifications from Ghemx on to smartwatch screens. Ghemx has pushed notifications out to my PineTime smartwatch and my Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid smartwatch. Now I\u0026rsquo;ll be the first to admit, my Bash language skills are unorthodox, and Ghemx should have been written in Python. Visualizing object oriented languages is not a skill I have access to on command. For example, this very simple password generator Python script that I call passgen took me about 40 hours to write, comment, and debug. Someone well versed in Python could have written a similar script in less than an hour.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot to process recently to say the least. Finding out that I\u0026rsquo;m not actually a terrible person was pretty good news. Also finding out that most of my impulsive decisions have been due to a misunderstanding of how my brain works was comforting as well.\nThanks goes out to the gods and goddesses of technology. Because I would be lost without it (literally lol).\nJuly 26, 2023 Pseudo-ADD Kelly casted confusion\nI love low powered bluetooth radios as much as the next person, but seriously, Fossil could have developed a wonderful watch with an estimated seven day battery life and it would have been so much better. Most of my problems with the FTW 7074 come from bluetooth interference within a few feet away from the phone.\nWith that said, The Fossil Hybrid watch has indirectly helped with voice activated timers. Small productivity boosters to help with daily side hustle tasks. And the rain percentage provided from voice commands appears to be somewhat accurate. I think it\u0026rsquo;s kind of funny that I can\u0026rsquo;t effectively ask for the current illumination or phase of the moon from the watch. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s effectively a water dog watch, so why not have all water dog things like wave height and moon phases? Though now that I think about it, reef surfers would probably break the \u0026lsquo;mineral\u0026rsquo; glass (not sapphire) within a few weeks.\nSince this is a mostly Linux website, KDE Connect does show up in the toggle-able apps to push notifications to the watch, but I\u0026rsquo;ve had to toggle it off for KDE Connect. It was a great for a week when KDE Connect ignored desktop computer MPRIS events. Now with notifications toggled on, KDE Connect will push notifications to my watch regarding each and every YouTube video I watch, or each song that plays from my desktop computer. Which is odd, because I do not receive these notifications on my phone, just my watch.\nAnd yea, I\u0026rsquo;m not writing that I have ADD on any my job applications. Until I have a firm diagnosis all I can say is that I have pseudo-add. This category ranges from occasionally losing the Roku remote to playing a MMORPG 16 hours a day because there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of structure, rules, and content to keep that person in a state of constant stimulation.\nThese days I\u0026rsquo;m consistently interrupted by my side hustle, which makes it impossible for me to join MMORPG guilds, raid/instance groups, or seige wars. So that helps. I have to admit though, it was an MMORPG that kick started a few of my focusing, and organizing tactics. Shout out to all the very fine Govinda server folks of Runes of Magic. Thanks for putting up with all my mailbox deaths.\nIt would be irresponsible if I didn\u0026rsquo;t mention that Runes of Magic is a F2P P2W game with a storyline that pushes peer pressure to spend money. And the item shop has a loot box like system. It costs somewhere upwards of $5,000 - $10,000 to jump start a record beating character. And at least $2,500 - $5,000 to join in with players that started in 2009. There are also people willing to outfit skillful players, but that will most likely lead to serfdom. Budget solo-ists like myself can easily get away with spending ~$200 for four years of playing a few hours a day. Just a friendly word of caution.\nAlso, the these days the player base is more aligned with the patrons of horse racing and or casinos, and not aligned with nerds that like to play World of Warcraft (very few anime nerds too). Those folks either quit are were zombified by life. Socializing in game is very similar to golfing country clubs (my grandfather was a groundskeeper near Chicago). Each guild is a different type of country club, with their own rules and expectations of players. I mean, some are fine with people golfing with a set of Robin clubs, while others expect their players to have a set of BERES and a parking space for their custom golf cart\u0026ndash;you know? Some guilds even go as far as forbidding players from using global chat for anything other than trade.\nObviously, a wildling like myself has very little patience for country club mentality. Scoffing is not something I waste energy on, but I do have the occasional snarky and or pranky moments. The one upside is that if playing via Linux, the Steam version of Runes of Magic will utilize Vulcan as the DirectX translation layer, which has boosted the hell out of performance. You know, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if Steam outright replaced older versions of DirectX with Vulcan.\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2022/0822/","title":"Blog | 08/22","parent":"2022","content":" Aug. 9, 2022 My wildling side. In the grand scheme of things, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t that long ago Aug. 11, 2022 The day a soccer goal chose violence Aug. 9, 2022 My wildling side. In the grand scheme of things, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t that long ago There are a lot of flashback posts from Aug. 9, 2022 to Jan. 14, 2023 (copy pasted from Bookface). Less personal posts start here.\nThe mobile home was behind Rumor\u0026rsquo;s Tavern (now a mattress store) of Gainesville, FL, which was where I lived with my folks from 1997-2001. They lost their home in Hawthorne, FL (where I learned to respect nature 1989-1996\u0026ndash;cotton mouth snakes, coral snakes, eastern diamond backs, etc.), and moved to Gainesville, FL. My old room window is visible\u0026ndash;the one closest to the bar. My Dad had a Vietnam War problem but wouldn\u0026rsquo;t admit it, and so I moved out when I was sixteen.\nThat storm drain guard rail marks the spot where the school bus picked us up in the morning. I sat on that storm drain guard rail while others sat on the concrete bus bench a few dozen yards to the right. The convenience store/gas station to the left of that railing was robbed four times under the same management. One morning a girl attempted to stab another girl one just after Ms. Dallas (our bus driver I think?) picked us up. I think I remember one of the chill middle school guys offering to share a joint. \u0026ldquo;Nah, I\u0026rsquo;m good man.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You sure?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo; Lots of bass booming vehicles passing through that area in the morning.\nLocal rowdy middle school boys found out I was decent at basketball while in a physical education class, and so they attempted to initiate me as part of their roaming bicycle group. I admired John Stockton back then for some reason (so many elbows..). Same ones that exited out the back door of the bus when we got stuck one morning. Same ones that made fun of me for practicing freestyle tricks on a skateboard (ironically before I learned of Rodney Mullen).\nAs I sat on that storm drain guard rail (probably while wearing my Goosebumps tie dyed t-shirt) one of them smashed an egg on my head. My guess was that the big guy was itching to fight someone, and my leave me alone face was bugging him. So with egg dripping down my face he asked me, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not mad?\u0026rdquo; I responded with a soft but stern, \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo; What they didn\u0026rsquo;t see is me walking back home to take a shower, and my Dad calling my Mom from work so that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t miss a day of school. They didn\u0026rsquo;t bother me much after that.\nThe positive side was that before moving to Gainesville, FL, I had no general sense of modern skateboarding. What I knew came from 1980s how to skateboard books. Kickflip? I knew more about what lived in Florida swamps and fishing than skateboarding. My first deck was actually a Status skate shop board. Probably sold via Play It Again Sports. My first pro model deck I believe was a 2001 Kerry Getz Habitat board (shown).\nAug. 11, 2022 The day a soccer goal chose violence My conscious keeps saying the world needs to know, and so here I am again.\nI was wearing a corduroy golf cap (Andy Capp style) turned backwards. It was hot. We were riding bikes on a soccer field\u0026ndash;featured in photo #2 (2007)\u0026ndash;this story is from 1997. As a former builder of makeshift launch ramps I needed excitement, so I thought riding through a soccer goal would be fun.\nThe first one I rode through did not have sidebars, and so I didn\u0026rsquo;t inspect the one ahead of where I was going. It had sidebars. One moment I was riding my bike, the next moment I was picking my self off the ground and picking one of my front teeth up at the same time, \u0026ldquo;Hey guys! I lost a tooth!\u0026rdquo; My twelve year old self had lost about six years of time in a few seconds. I knew to keep it in a cup of milk, but my concussion made it difficult to convey why that was important. I rinsed my mouth using the faucet on the side of the 20th Ave. fire station (we lived across the street, and yes it was loud), and I chuckled along with the doctor while he stitched me up at the local clinic. The other tooth was removed by a dentist for other reasons when I was in my twenties. Ok, hopefully that\u0026rsquo;s all the storytime I have for a while.\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2023/0823/","title":"Blog | 08/23","parent":"2023","content":" August 6, 2023 How to peel an orange with a sim card tool August 15, 2023 Vim forever August 17, 2023 Gold Leafed Marmalade August 6, 2023 How to peel an orange with a sim card tool Rereading some old favorites. And honestly, the sim card tool does most of the work.\n\u0026ldquo;The Girl Who Came Home\u0026rdquo;, is the only book on the 2READ pile that I haven\u0026rsquo;t read already. Pretty sure I read at least 50 of the first series Goosebumps books before 1998. It\u0026rsquo;s all about the embossing tbh.\nJust an ordinary tuna fish sandwich. Nothing to see here. Move along (all with stolen ingredients \u0026hellip; oh no).\nStill zooming along with Kubuntu 23.04 as my main operating system. My side hustle might not make me rich, but it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been interrupted by any technical difficulties. Though it would be irresponsible of me not to mention that 23.04 is NOT a long term release OS, and it is running on a tried and tested Thinkcentre M73 (w/pupgrades). Best case scenario sans running an Nvidia Quadro K620 in 2023 (oof? oof.).\nFossil FTW7074 Hybrid Watch Update:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fine. Pressing the Alexa button and saying, \u0026ldquo;cancel timer\u0026rdquo;, brings me to an nearly inescapable timer app. Which seems very unintuitive for a voice activated watch. The watch also still drops the Bluetooth signal while the phone is less than 3FT away. Possibly caused by my Avantree Oasis bluetooth transmitter. Sometimes making it difficult to set different timers. Yep, µAlexa requires an uplink to a server to function, go figure right?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been secretly working on isolating a ground loop crackle coming from the M73. It travels up the stereo cable from the PC, through the two channel Just Mixer headphone mixer, and through the transmitter to my bluetooth headphones. The obvious choice is to buy a decent sound card, which I will probably do once I open it up the M73 again and see how the PCIE cards are arranged. I figured it\u0026rsquo;s a ground loop issue because I can stop it by placing my hand on the connector housing of the input cable connected to the mixer (hand on mixer make work good). It might just be a bad cable, but in this instance, I have a good excuse to buy a new sound card.\nI know I\u0026rsquo;m caught up in nostalgia hype, and Gen-Z\u0026rsquo;rs are most likely profiting off my youth, but for a few seconds the other day I could imagine what it was like to walk out of the door of the family home in 1997. I could SMELL the open shed of .. bagged beverage cans as well. I guess the wind shifted during my recollection.\nAugust 15, 2023 Vim forever 2017 was my year with Vim, i3wm, Manjaro/Arch Linux. Vim can be seen in the top right window.\nI never knew Bram Moolenaar (creator of Vim). To be fair, I don\u0026rsquo;t get out much, so that could be part of it. Though I can\u0026rsquo;t speak of Moolenaar or of his character, I can say that Vim helped me organize my thoughts in a way I never thought possible. At this point in my late thirties, I\u0026rsquo;m nearly certain I have some form of attention deficit disorder. The major shift in organizing my life began in 2017 once I obtained confidence with Vim. The text editor melted away, and I could do what I wanted to do at the speed I wanted to do it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a spot in my main Tmuxinator config file for a combination life journal and system maintenance log that I type in everyday (created: December 16, 2017 @ 6:13pm). Which was created using Vim, and updated using Vim. All the pet project scripts I\u0026rsquo;ve written since 2017 were created using Vim. It is one of the first programs I install on a new system, and it is the program I miss the most when I\u0026rsquo;m using Vi.\nIf I wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a monster of a visual person, I would be using Vim to type this blog entry. Previewing markup files using Vim was not something I could do comfortably, so hopefully that explains my monstrosity. I have two documents that I edit everyday in Vim, and I will keep using Vim, whether it be from a terminal emulator, Termux, or Linux console.\nI obviously really enjoy his creation, and I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry to have heard of his passing. RIP.\nAugust 17, 2023 Gold Leafed Marmalade I promise to never use AI memes or text for this blog. Bam, done. Pizza time\nMothballed two @csmertx social media accounts recently. The only websites I check anymore are Imgur and Facebook. For the piping hot Star Trek memes of course. And I do my best to avoid the mud thrown in the Red vs. Blue mudslinging match. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot like dodging water balloons on the last day of high school (catapults .. ).\nThe trick is the spot the airborne balloon, and assume it\u0026rsquo;s not full of water..\nAnd I tell you what, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for inexpensive jeans for work that are more durable than certain outdoor brands, look for surplus uniform jeans on Ebay. These sellers inspect, sort, and wash the pants (depending on the seller ofc). Mostly Redkap brand, which are also sold new through Amazon. What makes then better? Industrial grade stitching, extra belt loops, poly blend for stretch/cooling, and YKK zippers. Some spots included, but who cares? They\u0026rsquo;re work pants.\nAlso, how do people just sit down and have a conversation with a virtual theater of people? Like, they just do that, and it\u0026rsquo;s rad. I envy your ability to sit still long enough to make that happen. With so many words in the US English language, and so many dialects, and it all just rolls off your tongues. It\u0026rsquo;s as easy to you as eating this slice of pizza is to me.\n*unapologetic pineapple chunk noises*\n"},{"id":25,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2022/0922/","title":"Blog | 09/22","parent":"2022","content":" Sep. 1, 2022 RIP Spider-man.

This one hurt my psyche quite a bit Sep, 8, 2022 From when I worked at United Tote Sep. 18, 2022 Too ambitious to be a bench warmer Sep. 1, 2022 RIP Spider-man. You were loved. This story required a separate post. Something I had to get out. My first grade bus driver Mr. Savage for whatever reason assigned seating. I was assigned to sit next to a Spider-Man fan. He was in kindergarten. And like most kids do, we got into a few heated discussions about Superman vs. Spider-Man. During one of those arguments I made the kid cry, and Mr. Savage re-assigned me to a new seat. This was around the time my father broke the leaf off a table with his fist, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t try on a pair of shoes before taking off the tags (Vietnam War problem). The kid\u0026ndash;I wish I could remember his name\u0026ndash;for some reason was absent for a few days. Obviously, I felt guilty for being so damn mean. I liked Spider-Man and Superman. I probably would have even liked Aquaman had I known of that superhero. At Shell Elementary school, even though there was an intercom system, some of the news was announced by our teachers. The teacher said that the boy dropped his books as he and his Mom were crossing the road, and his decision to retrieve his books without looking out for traffic ended his life.\nI loved books (still love books). I don\u0026rsquo;t fall into another world as I read fiction like I did before, but I use to be completely immersed in the stories. I mean, in first grade I wasn\u0026rsquo;t reading novels, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t need the pictures to visualize what was happening. We had something in common, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get past the Superman vs. Spider-Man argument. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that he died to make me nicer. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that this tragic event had to happen for my benefit. In my opinion that\u0026rsquo;s completely asinine. However, I did take meaning from what happened. It took a few decades for me to realize that I was not to blame. No one was to blame. It was a tragic accident.\nI feel like I may have made amends as I progressed through to high school and in to the real world. When people spoke to me I listened, and I tried to be as accommodating as possible. In my twenties, as a shift manager at CVS, part of my duty was to shift the direction of shouting customers away from other associates on towards myself. And as everyone knows, when someone has to wait an extended period of time for their medication, they have a lot of frustration to offload. Some of them would thank me for letting them vent. Even though \u0026lsquo;venting\u0026rsquo; consisted of them yelling in my face. It was something I developed over time that took a lot of patience and careful attuning to the issues at hand. I try my best to make things right if possible. And if that means swallowing my pride for a little while, then so be it. I can\u0026rsquo;t let that happen again.\nSep. 5, 2022 Coupé de ville I was new to the feeling of driving a floating boat of a Cadillac. I believe I worked truck @ CVS that morning, which meant coming in at 3am and getting off at 3pm. Blessed vinyl extraordinaire along for the ride for some reason. We were driving south on 441 just past GHS, about to take a right on to 16th ave.. Not swerving, but no power steering made it difficult to drive super straight. Blue and red flashed in my rear view mirror. I pull into a Citgo gas station parking space and realized my lights were shining through the Citgo building window, so I turned my headlights off. The people that owned the place were always nice to my friends and I, so at least I could return the favor.\nMr. Officer decided it was DUI time, so he asked me to get out and do some of those perfectly accurate physical sobriety tests. Blessed vinyl extraordinaire asked to speak with Mr. Officer privately. I have no idea what was said between them, but after a few minutes I was given a ticket for driving without headlights, and was told my friend would have to drive home\u0026ndash;which was only several hundred feet away. Had he not been along for the ride, I would have spent at least a few nights in jail (thank you).\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s the end of the story right? I paid the $80 ticket for being a skater type and driving a purple Cadillac while mildly tired, and all was well. Nope. You see, I paid with a check. The check was sent back, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of this until there was a notice in the mail stating that my license was suspended. This was during a time when only money orders were the only acceptable payment method for tickets. Ok, this had to have been a mistake right? My first ticket, and this happens. I hired a lawyer to appear in court and save my bacon. On court day I drove to a Broward County courtroom. Within the first 30 minutes of sitting among an auditorium of people waiting for their mini trials, I watched a young and intelligent man get charged with years of jail for selling a small amount of weed. I was waiting maybe an hour before my turn. I stepped up in front of the judge\u0026ndash;my lawyer took one look at me and said one word, \u0026ldquo;guilty\u0026rdquo;, to the judge. The car was impounded six months previously because it was towed before I could get it fixed. And I paid an additional $350 afterwards because Mr. Officer was being a Mr. Officer.\nI used a cassette tape to stereo plug adapter with my RCA Lyra rd1071 MP3 player to play tunes through the Bose speakers. And wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you know it, the door of the MP3 player battery compartment was held shut with a piece of duct tape. A year earlier the player flew out of my pocket while I was riding my bike up and down 16th avenue. In fact, the road was so steep, one time my Suntour back derailleur derailed itself onto the sidewalk. Anyway, the player was loaded with songs from The White Stripes (Elephant), Boards of Canada (Music has the Right to Children), Dragonforce (Inhuman Rampage), and Ratatat (Ratatat \u0026amp; Classics). Probably more, but back then an SD card only held so many MP3s (1-2GB).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know how many times I\u0026rsquo;ve heard the sentence, \u0026ldquo;Have you ever been arrested before?\u0026rdquo; But I\u0026rsquo;ll take that over another pat down anyday shivers. To be clear, it\u0026rsquo;s been 13 years since my last ticket, my driver\u0026rsquo;s license is in good standing, and I always have proof of insurance. When pulled over in the future, the only thing I\u0026rsquo;ll switch off is my windshield wipers.\nSep. 6, 2022 High school drafting class. This one hurt my psyche quite a bit Ok, granted, this was about twenty years ago, but I still think about it from time to time. My folks smoked cigarettes to cut through the monotony of the day to day grind. And they smoked in the house, ergo, I smelled like smoke. This was during the period in my life when I moved in with my then girlfriend and her family because Vietnam War reasons. So, at the start of my drafting class, I smelled like smoke. And my drafting teacher assumed I smoked my breakfast before class. She said this to me while confiscating my Tech Deck. I think she meant that I was too skinny, and picked up a bad habit at an early age. She also liked to call me urchin in front of the class. Which basically means street rat or hedgehog. I ate what was available to me, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t smoke cigarettes. But I did like to skate, which I guess was 75% of why she said that.\nAt some point I realized that I was going to get a D in the class if I don\u0026rsquo;t take advantage of the extra credit assignment. She loved to scoff at my work for the rest of the class to take notice, and when I asked what was wrong, she would ignore me and continue to the next student. The extra credit assignment was literally my favorite part of that class, which was to design a vehicle using four wheels powered by a rubber band propeller using a sheet of foam board, scissors, and tape or glue. I won\u0026rsquo;t name who my teacher grouped me with (now an architect? idk). He probably never had to use his hands for much at all, which I should have taken into account before I started the design process. I had seen a few prototype car videos, so I decided to create a curved design for the least amount of wind resistance. And the propeller in a push configuration instead of a pull configuration. It sort of looked like a cross between a delta wing and a prototype sports car. Only with a big rubber band powered propeller on the back.\nOnce the design was finished, I tasked my partner with cutting out all the pieces\u0026ndash;not very neighborly of me. Once completed, I assembled the car, and he complained to our drafting teacher because his hand was sore. He probably thought he just finished a manual labor job or something like that I don\u0026rsquo;t know what was going on in his head. I had done odd jobs since I was seven, so I had no sense of what was hard work for my age group. Maybe I should have spent less time talking with a friend, and included my partner in the design process. I believe there was a physical line to cross to gain extra credit, and a bit of a contest to see which vehicle could go the farthest. Our car won, so, extra credit right? Well, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you know it, the designer and builder of the car did not get the extra credit, and failed that class. Had my teacher been more open to listening to my side of the story would I have been an architect or industrial designer? No, probably not. But still, what hell.\nSep, 8, 2022 From when I worked at United Tote United Tote was/is the parimutuel wagering vendor of Pompano Park, Pompano Beach, Florida. All day yesterday the \u0026ldquo;silly ol\u0026rsquo; Winniee the Poooh\u0026rdquo; part of the The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh theme song played in my head. And so, here\u0026rsquo;s another long winded story. Operators showed up for the early morning shift or for the overnight shift. Technicians worked the overnight shift. As an operator, the start of our day involved double checking the live race card (harness race track). If a horse was scratched\u0026ndash;removed from the race\u0026ndash;then changes needed to be made by an operator, so that no one places an impossible bet. As an operator of the morning shift, we performed a lot of the easy technician duties. If someone punched a screen and cracked it, we were called to replace it. But most of our day was spent changing out rolls of self checkout wagering machine paper. Occasionally we would have to cancel a stolen ticket, or work with track management to figure out something to do with someone\u0026rsquo;s players club card (VIP card). Technicians knew quite a bit more about the machines, so main board changes and such were left for when the technicians arrived for their shifts.\nThere was a period of time in which one of the technicians went on vacation for a month, and so I was asked if I would like to take his shifts for some overtime. I enjoy learning how things work, and I guess I was good enough at documenting work performed that I was asked to work the extra shifts. At the time, I had very little since my move to South Florida. All my stuff was back in Gainesville, FL, and my last car was probably sold for scrap from one of the impound lots a few months before I moved. Ninety hour work weeks sounded tough, but I needed a car, and had trouble with impulse spending. There\u0026rsquo;s also a thriving karaoke culture in South Florida, and it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat addictive and expensive. Thirteen years later, and I still remember the majority of the lyrics from my songs. Anyway, so I came in as an operator in the morning, and left as a technician the following morning. A little bit of sleep, and back to work again. Unfortunately, my relationship did not survive the overtime opportunity. Actually it was fortunate, because we weren\u0026rsquo;t right for each. She was lonely, and I was doing my best to save for a car and pay my half of everything including the HBO package (of which I did not have access when I moved out of her room). There was a Hungry Howies close by that had that cheeseburger pizza. I quickly realized my favorite fast food pizza place. Later I would learn that their Hawaiian pizza is even better. I grew up with pineapple on ham casserole things.\nOne of the folks that worked directly with the track (we were a permanent vendor operation) once called me Christopher Robin, because our manager had a tattoo of Eore, and I had a way of of avoiding the trouble that our manager and the other employees got into outside of work. The name of the guy that called me Christopher Robin was Joe. I believe he was an announcer for live race days. He was one of the few people that spoke to me without a condescending tone in his voice. Which I appreciated. Even though the machines were from the late 80s or early 90s, it was the first job in which I felt I was using my natural aptitude. Which in an odd way was rewarding. The place was kind of depressing though. Termites made it so that entire floors were out of order. Not a lot of smiling faces either. Quite a change from my humble beginnings in Hawthorne/Gainesville, FL. I never placed a wager too, so I was kind of on the outside looking inward.\nSep. 18, 2022 Too ambitious to be a bench warmer This one is from 1995 (I was 11). Which wasn\u0026rsquo;t that long ago. I have a confession to make. I played two years of little league baseball, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hit the ball. It didn\u0026rsquo;t matter who pitched\u0026ndash;whether or not I crowded the plate or did the opposite\u0026ndash;I was either walked to first base, struck out, or was caught looking at all three strikes. Naturally, when my team was at bat, coach (all of them) put me on the bench. The baseball fields were often next to racquet ball courts (perfect for wall ball), and sometimes playgrounds.\nIt was nearly impossible to make me sit on a bench when I was surrounded by so much fun. Our team was up to bat, and I was off the bench on a solo adventure. Was it an all star game? I guess that\u0026rsquo;s not important. Near a small building a few dozen feet away from the bleachers, I hear a voice. It\u0026rsquo;s odd that I would hear one individual voice out of all the yelling coming from proud parents, and random kids playing, but her voice was different. \u0026ldquo;Why wont anyone play with me?!\u0026rdquo; The resignation in her voice combined with the near lack of a southern accent was what really caught my attention. As a kid once with a slight British accent adapted from preschool in Bermuda, I knew what it was like to be an outsider in North Central Florida. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but ask her if she wanted to play catch. \u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t have a glove.\u0026rdquo; I believe she said. A few under hand throws later, and our attention shifted to the pull up bars nearby. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember much other than showing her how to penny drop, because unfortunately, our time was cut short. A man from near the bleachers was calling her name. By the tone of his voice, she was in trouble, and he was most likely a legal guardian. It was obviously time for her to go. I believe she said \u0026ldquo;thank you\u0026rdquo;, and we both went our separate ways.\nHave I seen her since then? I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure, but I\u0026rsquo;m thankful that something good came out of my inability to hit a baseball.\n"},{"id":26,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2022/1022/","title":"Blog | 10/22","parent":"2022","content":" Oct. 28, 2022 How I learned to shovel, and why working sucks Oct. 28, 2022 How I learned to shovel, and why working sucks I started my first job at the age of seven. Our family dog (black labrador) had a litter of puppies, and I was tasked to care for them (which included shoveling). So, for a few months I moved around dog food, filled bowls, and crawled into the makeshift puppy kennel in our backyard to complete my daily waste extraction quest. Hawthorne, Florida circa early 90s. I believe I was payed $10 a week\u0026ndash;not sure about those details\u0026ndash;it was a little while ago.\nThe kennel was about double puppy height, because my dog Ninja learned that he could climb the chicken wire fence. With that knew discovery, Dad created the perfect puppy ambush box made of chicken wire (ambushed by puppy kisses everyday). I wanted to save for a Super Nintendo, and Dad said he would hold on to the money. \u0026ldquo;The lawn won\u0026rsquo;t mow itself.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Put shit in one hand, and WANT in another, and what do you get?\u0026rdquo;\nWouldn\u0026rsquo;t you know it, around the same time all the puppies were adopted, a new beer brewing kit appeared in the house. I worked a few paying \u0026lsquo;jobs\u0026rsquo; before I got a real job at the age of 15, but that first job stung a little. Dad was awesome when his pain levels were tolerable. He worked so hard that some of the rubber parts in his spine wore away. Alcohol probably eased the pain, but definitely wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best solution. Well, a bad solution to a problem that the military said wasn\u0026rsquo;t due to his two decades of service. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have things. Oh I had things. It\u0026rsquo;s just\u0026ndash;this is something I was working towards. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine there was a lot of shitty laundry to do too (ba dum tss).\nI\u0026rsquo;m two years away from 40 now\u0026ndash;which is fine\u0026ndash;we all move out our own pace. Those that judge me harshly probably don\u0026rsquo;t have the time or energy to walk a mile in someone else\u0026rsquo;s Family Dollar shoes.\n"},{"id":27,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2022/1122/","title":"Blog | 11/22","parent":"2022","content":" Nov. 4, 2022 Mana from U-Store-It Nov. 4, 2022 Mana from U-Store-It The time period created a movie known as Office Space. It was a time of great technological upheaval, and a time of great technological waste. Many were upgrading to new systems, including private and public schools. Trent Reznor was one of the newest musical talents to have music videos, Quake the computer game had only been out a few years, and Intel Pentium II \u0026amp; III machines were tossed away in favor of laptops and more portable desktop computers.\nActually, a lot were tossed because the internet was fresh, and lightly dusted with viruses and malware. Good hard disk drives with some years left bogged down by a lot of bad late night decisions. McAfee Stinger was a favorite of mine. Use it to scan for infected files, find the infected files, and slowly replace them with uninfected files pulled and scanned from the WWW. ClamAV is better IMO.\nThe dumpsters by the storage units generally had non-perishable waste receptacles. The same types rented for deck or fence removal. So climbing into them was a smart idea right? Anyway, with bro\u0026rsquo;s help and guidance we came across a few desktop towers, one confirmed working monitor, and it was time to get to work.\nI ended up with a Pentium III system running Windows 95. It could run Quake, what else did I need it for at the age of 14? And it had a CD-ROM drive, so I could listen to those sweet Nine Inch Nail jams. Beige tower, Microsoft whatever ball mouse, and if I remember correctly a neat Dell keyboard (AT101?).

In a large bowl, mix the vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder and coriander. In a separate bowl, mix the broth, tahini, tomato paste, soy sauce and liquid smoke.\nIn the bowl with the dry ingredients, make a small moat in the middle and then pour the wet ingredients into the dry bowl. Mix the ingredients quickly (you’ll see that the mixture thickens within seconds, so be ready to mix it fast). Knead the “dough” for about a minute. Normally for seitan recipes you knead for up to five minutes, but to keep this as “tender” as possible, only knead for a minute or so.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Flatten the mix out onto the baking pan so that it reaches the edges and then cut into rib strips as thick or thin as you like. Because the dough is a little clingy, it actually works best to cut these strips with a pizza cutter. Bake for 25 minutes then remove from the oven and coat the top generously with barbeque sauce. Flip it, coat the other side, and then put back in the oven for another 15 minutes.

Add 21⁄2 cups of the gluten to the slurry and mix well, either using the food processor or by hand in the bowl.\nIf you’re using a food processor, keep pulsing to knead the dough, adding a little more gluten flour as necessary to form a stiff dough (the more gluten you add, the chewier your ribs will be, so you can control how tender or chewy you want them). It may form one ball in the center or break up into little beads; if the latter happens, all you have to do is push it together with your hands. If you’re mixing it by hand, knead it in the bowl for several minutes until it becomes smooth.\nRoll the dough into a log about 6 inches long. Slice the log lengthwise into four “steaks” about 3⁄4 inch thick. Now here’s one of the places where you get to decide whether or not to use oil, and how much. Heat a skillet over medium-low heat—if you’re going for oil-free, make sure that it is nonstick. If you’re using oil, add a couple of tablespoons to the skillet and let it get hot. Add the steaks and cook until browned on both sides. They will rise and puff a little.\nPreheat the oven to 350°F. If your skillet is ovenproof, you can just leave the steaks in the pan. If not, transfer them to a baking dish. Mix 11⁄2 cups of the barbecue sauce with the water. Pour the diluted sauce over the steaks in the pan and cover with a lid or aluminum foil.\nBake the ribs for 75 to 90 minutes, until the sauce has reduced and just barely coats them and the steaks are chewy and cooked through. They will be relatively tender while hot but will deflate slightly and become chewier as they cool, so fear not if they seem too soft right out of the oven.\nLet them cool until they can be handled without burning your fingers. Then slice each steak lengthwise into “ribs” about 1⁄3 to 1⁄2 inch thick. Heat the skillet over medium-low heat. You’re going to sauté the individual ribs once more to brown or even blacken them on both sides. Once again, you can choose to oil or not to oil. If you like your ribs on the greasy side, you’ll want to use a good 4 to 6 tablespoons of oil to sauté them. Or you can just use a dry nonstick skillet. Cook them all until nicely dark on both sides (I like them almost black). Then toss them with the remaining 2 to 21⁄2 cups barbecue sauce. Now you can dig in. Or wait until the next day, when they will have deepened in flavor and become even chewier. To reheat, just throw them in the oven or on the grill, or eat them cold with some potato salad—yum! Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 6 months.\n"},{"id":163,"href":"/Linux/Software/vim/","title":"Vim","parent":"Software","content":"\nCut/Copy Paste Registers not working vim ~/.vimrc\n-- set clipboard+=unnamed ++ set clipboard=unnamed Spellcheck vim ~/.vimrc\n++ set spell spelllang=en_us Movement\n] + s = Next misspelled word\n[ + s = Prev misspelled word\nSuggestions\nz + = Add to dictionary\nz + g Mark for later\nz + w turn off with :set nospell\nOr edit ~/.vimrc and add :map \u0026lt;F7\u0026gt;

At the end of 2020 I stumbled in to some remote contract work. This job required the use of a keyboard, and a lot of typing. Instead of spending time and money on future RSI surgeries, I decided to get an urklenomic keyboard. The problem with the keyboard I bought (aside from the price tag) was that my wrists would go numb after four hours. Not as urklenomic as I\u0026rsquo;d like. The thin sponge wrist rests sold by the company did not help. That\u0026rsquo;s why I made these.\nThe silicone is too soft. I used Ecoflex 00-10 from Smooth-On (commonly used to make shoe insoles), and mixed in some sparkly black mica powder. After about a year the silicone began to flake away from the surface of the wrist rests. Still easier to clean than any other option on the market. Version #2 will be a medium durometer silicone, and the shape of the wrist rests will be less half a fudge brownie and more of a full keyboard sized shape. The plan is to carve the shape (or master) out of walnut. When casting silicone with silicone it\u0026rsquo;s best to use a durometer that\u0026rsquo;s squishier than the mold. Otherwise they\u0026rsquo;ll fuse together. And no, I have no intention of making anything other than tax deductible office products. Maybe fishing lures. Though I\u0026rsquo;d use a biodegradable plastisol instead of silicone for lures.\n"},{"id":172,"href":"/Linux/Assorted/xresources/","title":"X resources","parent":"Assorted Informaton","content":"\nSet padding, DPI, anti-alising, Xcursor theme, X font settings, etc.\nTime saver for certain terminal emulators (URxvt, xterm, etc.)\nXresources Example vim ~/.Xresources\n!
