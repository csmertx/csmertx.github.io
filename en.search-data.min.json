Thankfully the spider wasn\u0026rsquo;t a biter. What had happened was (pauses for effect) I tried on the shirt, and realized the bootleg shirt was about the same size as an XL (bound to shrink too). Also the rectangle print made noise as I moved. Like a crinkly sound. I am a 2XL tall, and this was a crinkly XL short. Ah well. A few moments after I took the shirt off the 🔗 pirate spider crawled up my right love handle. That\u0026rsquo;s when I noticed the telltale sensation of a spider crawling on me flesh. Thankfully I had the foresight to move my finger onto its path so that I could place it on the desk to snap a few pictures. Tiny one, so not likely to harbor eggs, but still. The uh, bag the shirt shipped in had vent holes, and the shirt was 100% machined folded. Plenty of opportunities for spider hitchhikers. I was not in contact with trees or spider webs that afternoon, and it\u0026rsquo;s not garden spider season. Plus notice the shape of the front appendages\nObviously, for natural reasons and crawling reasons neither spider nor shirt survived the night.\nI have plans to turn my internal PC Blu-ray drive to an external to make room for a little SSD/HDD cold-swap bay. All these extra drives around collecting dust when I could be trying exciting operating systems. Also have a copy of Windows 10 on an M.2 SATA drive of which I can use with my new m.2 SATA to 2.5in SATA enclosure. Might need Windows for work. Probably use it for video games. Eventually I\u0026rsquo;ll move my two containerized environments (Nextcloud via SnapCraft \u0026amp; Jellyfin via Docker) onto a separate machine. If I keep it up I\u0026rsquo;ll eventually need something like an 🔗 Ansible playbook to manage all the containers. I can already write responsible web scraping\u0026ndash;without Python\u0026ndash;for javascript webpages and a bunch of other backend stuff, so I don\u0026rsquo;t see the harm in playing around with containers. Maybe some Kubernetes too if I ever deploy a Pi stack. Figuring out a way to login to a central 🔗 VSCode\u0026ndash;development environment I use for this website\u0026ndash;host would be cool too. I mean, having a central yoink drive for emergencies would be pretty sweet.\nI know, this is very riveting inside baseball huh? And who places rivets inside baseballs anyway? Talk about over engineering. Sheesh.\nIn other news, I recently dug into the history of the 🔗 Y.M.C.A. song due to its newfound popularity from within the U.S. President-Elect\u0026rsquo;s 2024 campaign. I have two thoughts on the subject. The primary thought is that one of the two writers, 🔗 Victor Edward Willis is very much pro money\u0026ndash;unwilling to deny the use of the song\u0026ndash;because money. The second thought I have may be on the minds of most people has to do with the much more popular 🔗 Jacques Morali\u0026rsquo;s co-written angle of the song. Morali, late leader of the very popular 70s/80s group, brought together people to form the 🔗 Village People, whom each represented \u0026lsquo;macho gay-fantasy personas\u0026rsquo;. So Morali\u0026rsquo;s take of the song is very much from the perspective of youths at the time that used 🔗 YMCA facilities to clean up, shape up, and hook up with other men. The likes of who may not have felt as represented by U.S. Presidential-Elect\u0026rsquo;s 2024 U.S. Presidential Campaign rival 🔗 U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. It\u0026rsquo;s also a song commonly used during baseball\u0026rsquo;s 🔗 7th inning stretch. An example via Spotify can be found 🔗 here played by the Giants Organist(s).\nMoney, dancing support, and the quintessential male vote (my best guess). Also, seems like our U.S. President-Elect does NOT want to visit Canada, Panama, and Greenland for some reason. Which is a shame. Canada is beautiful this time of year.\nsnip - Trade deals acquired for Mexico/Canada. 🔗 Occam\u0026rsquo;s razor strikes again!\nNow, there are some secrets I cannot reveal, for they are not my secrets to reveal regardless of what the crowd does or says. This includes from within a pool of potential jurors. I cannot and will not regardless of potential punishments. But I can guarantee you that my body language will at times tell a story that I cannot and must not tell. I am very much grateful for the eagle eyed within that Alachua County courtroom. For what I\u0026rsquo;m referring too, family was NOT responsible. What I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced as a child at a YMCA bathroom outside a public swimming pool in the early 90s does not even compare. She (grown adult stranger) was a little forward while attempting to undo my swim trunk knot. Back then it was pretty common for young boys to be terrified of their swim shorts coming off. I think it was popular humiliation gimmick in 90s kids sitcoms. Which when I think about it is kind of ironic considering I could not swim. Her early to late 20s voice was kind of like Rogue\u0026rsquo;s voice of the hit 90s cartoon 🔗 X-Men: The Animated Series. If I recall correctly, she was in the Men\u0026rsquo;s bathroom because she was with her own child. I think what frustrated my 8-year-old brain more than anything was giving up control to a stranger. I was told to yell, kick, punch, hit, and bite like hell if someone tried to take me away. But I was never prepared for a sultry voice.\nI was pretty good with a 🔗 Bō staff too 🐱‍🏍\nAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking into how I can convert this 🔗 Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard (KA2) into a Bluetooth or 2.4G wireless keyboard. There\u0026rsquo;s an interesting project on the subject I may reference, but I want make my own. I\u0026rsquo;d like to have an inline fuse to protect the keyboard against faulty batteries. That and extend the keyboard with a 3D printed battery compartment much like the backside bump on the 🔗 HHKB Professional HYBRID Type-S. Since interest has waned on my preferred keyboard it could be interesting to stealthily make a custom board for it. Theoretically the board could be similar to the 🔗 KinT controller board, but with a wireless module. Probably time to upgrade the wired touchpad I use to a 🔗 Magic Trackpad. I like the Kinesis Advantage for being a split layout keyboard that I can pick up with one hand. I\u0026rsquo;m not pinching my shoulders or wrists as I type too. I mean, it was also featured in the hit movie 🔗 Men In Black. Might be a good time to get my hands on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. With all that being said, the 🔗 HHKB Studio calls out to me. What a beautiful little device. I just might suffer through discomfort to have that little keyboard on the desk. I\u0026rsquo;ve already built my own KinT controller board from scratch (🔗 link), and I have some understanding of keyboard hacking from my time spent on the 🔗 Geekhack forum as Csmertx \u0026amp; Xtrafrood. So uh, could be a fun starter project for someone with rudimentary knowledge of circuitry.\nWriting posts on Geekhack is how I learned to chunk out paragraphs like I do in this blog. I just\u0026ndash;well, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t much of a keyboard warrior 🐱‍💻\nAnd here is the litany of fear from Frank Herbert\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Dune\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026#34;I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\u0026#34; An old ex-pro skater/Christian band leader friend of mine that took me to a Sunday school at a Lutheran church once told me:\n\u0026#34;Fear is only temporary. Death is forever.\u0026#34; I\u0026rsquo;d never attended Sunday school at a Lutheran church before. Thank you.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll never hold hate in my heart. Only disappointment.\nAh yes, 2025. This is going to be a good year. The giant pores in my nose are ready for their close-ups.\nJanuary 26, 2025 Fitbit Sense 2 - Alexa App See N\u0026rsquo; Say Mode Activated YouTube link of short (with audio) 🔗 here\nSeveral years ago I dedicated spare time to organizing my life. It was something I needed to do to become a more productive member of society. For me this was not exactly an enjoyable experience. As part of the organization process I wrote a simple script I called 🔗 ghemx. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have an Amazon Echo or a phone with a digital assistant, so I wrote my own sort of egg timer script. With that script I could keep track of washing machine cycles, dryer cycles, and reminders for 13-72 hours in the future. I wrote it from scratch via 🔗 Bash shell scripting, because I am in fact a mad lad. Are their Python libraries I could of used to make writing it easier? Oh sure. Anyway, as you know there are many ways to interact with timers, and many of those ways do not include labeling the timers. Labeling the timers and calling them back from a config file was why I wrote the script. I incorporated the timer script into the operating system I was using to see the timer at a glance, but that\u0026rsquo;s another rabbit hole altogether. Or gopher turtle hole if you\u0026rsquo;d like. Me remembering why I set a timer 55 minutes ago? lol.\n==\u0026gt; ghemx -m 55 -t \u0026quot;Washing Machine\u0026quot; \u0026amp; -m = minute, -t = title, r = hour, \u0026amp; = run in background\nThe output notification looks like this: Washing Machine [00h:55m:00s]\nOk, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a blog post about my super duper great Star Trek named timer script. I have an issue. Many people have this issue. And I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned this issue in other posts. My symptoms share many of the symptoms associated with ADHD. The thing is, I live in Florida, which is not known for helping money challenged individuals sort out their mental disorders. My guess is that Florida is not the only state with the issue of non-existent mental health facilities for the currency challenged. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know, this is my only state of residency. With all that said, I have to make due with a combination of technology and awareness. The first step was to read several books on the subject (written by real doctors). The second step was to find a way to be slightly less money challenged to afford such devices. The third step is avoid all money sinks like \u0026lsquo;healing\u0026rsquo; crystals, \u0026lsquo;protection\u0026rsquo; scamulets, and pay to win video games. The only aura I have is mild aura migraines. While I must admit, I may not be doing financially well for 40, in comparison to how I was I\u0026rsquo;m doing pretty terrific.\n\u0026ldquo;Get on with it nerd.\u0026rdquo; Ok, fine. I will sheesh.\nOn January 19, 2025, sometime between 06:45PM and 11:55PM my Fitbit Sense 2 Amazon Alexa app switched modes. It transitioned from a useful voice assistant that I can interact with, to what is essentially a toy for toddlers (shown in the image above). To be fair it definitely has more animals in that specific database when compared to an actual 🔗 See N\u0026rsquo; Say. This is not a malfunction of the Fitbit Sense 2, but a malfunction of the Alexa app for the Fitbit Sense 2. And, as far as I\u0026rsquo;m aware, the malfunction is localized to my device. My Alexa (via watch) transcripts would probably show a few coffee timers in the morning, food cooking timers during the day, a few word definitions at night, maybe a few oddball questions, and finally a few alarms just before bed. The other functions of the watch are no different than before January 19, 2025. Actually, Alexa does not directly interact with the watch itself aside from setting alarms. Even timers set using the Alexa app are independent of the watch operating system. So if I won the \u0026lsquo;someone did this on purpose\u0026rsquo; lottery, the affect does not alter my sleep tracking, heart rate monitor, or location data. And god(s) forbid if I became a suspect for some unknown reason, the data from the watch once subpoenaed, would be just as useful with or without Alexa enabled. It\u0026rsquo;s just a damn shame, because the speaker is working again. I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned in the 🔗 past that it had water damage. Probably from washing my hands while using the Spigen case. I installed that case to protect from 🔗 drops. I\u0026rsquo;d also used the watch Alexa app a few times to set reminder timers while driving.\n01-31-25 - Fitbit Support said it was Amazon\u0026rsquo;s issue. Two levels of tech support with Amazon led to, \u0026ldquo;This issue will be resolved within 48 hours.\u0026rdquo; Will there be a third level of support? Probably not. Switched to 🔗 Gemini on my Pixel phone. Full integration via Google Suite? Sorry Alexa, it\u0026rsquo;s been real. Plus, the Capella voice sounds so disinterested in everything. Nice.\nI mentioned that the speaker only functions with Alexa 🔗 here, mostly because I\u0026rsquo;ve used simple watches that are 80% of the price and have an audible alarm. It\u0026rsquo;s just silly to limit the capabilities of an otherwise decent watch for arbitrary reasons. Now, I know that what I wear on my wrist is affordable for many reasons. In fact, I picked it over a Garmin Fenix, and Samsung Galaxy because Amazon offers monthly payments for certain items. I\u0026rsquo;ve also never worried about wearing the Sense 2. It\u0026rsquo;s the 2020s, millions of people wear smartwatches. Anyway, no one is hurt, we\u0026rsquo;re all mentally sound, and I can still set unlabeled timers using the timer app on the watch for stuff. Also, 62 bpm average for 2024 :). For the longer timers I can use the desktop or laptop, and 🔗 KDE Connect will push the resulting notification to the watch. And after this post is published my mind will be free of the frustration anyway. That\u0026rsquo;s part of the fun.\nLittle did I know that writing off fears and frustrations was/is a major motivation of one of the most prolific horror writers of our time. I also found his consistent adherence to his working class roots (shit kicker boots) inspiring.\nThis Fitbit Sense 2 Alexa app issue is another issue to sink my teeth into. I realize that Fitbit probably never developed the kind of granular control needed to explicitly compromise a device. Say, make the a specific Alexa App switch to See N\u0026rsquo; Say mode. The infrastructure to do that with millions of individual devices\u0026ndash;also a few different skews\u0026ndash;would be totes expensive. Like ultra mega totes expensive. Plus the skews for a See N\u0026rsquo; Say mode device for toddlers and my Sense 2 are (are?) quite a bit different. Through Bluetooth no-less. It is interesting to know that a bug could cause a database switch-a-roo like that. Knowing there\u0026rsquo;s a device out there with a See N\u0026rsquo; Say mode gives me hope for humanity. Cow goes moooo you know? Do you?\nI kind of envy the technical support staff and engineers of Fitbit Support tbh\nIn other news about my life, which is very much still happening (pretty neat huh?), I still don\u0026rsquo;t have a 3D printer. Space and heat are an issue. But uh, I think I have a solution for that. Hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll at least have the 🔗 hot room part worked out by the summer. To be fair, the 3D printer stuff might not be something a random person reading this would be concerned about. And to be fair again, I\u0026rsquo;m barely concerned about 3D printing stuff. But, if I did own a 3D printer it certainly wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be an FDM printer. Not that there\u0026rsquo;s anything wrong with FDM, it\u0026rsquo;s just\u0026mdash;listen, I\u0026rsquo;d rather have a part ready for paint. Prints with inherent structural rigidity too. Maybe after messing around with the first printer I\u0026rsquo;ll branch off to an FDM printer that can print bigger stuff at a higher resolution. With all that said, I\u0026rsquo;m worried an FDM printer would stop my design-y-flow-state. I have a few ideas for desk stuff that I\u0026rsquo;d like to get out of the way first.\nI highly recommend 🔗 Flightradar24 btw. A little thank you for reading this far\nI want to make interesting things ready for painting. I\u0026rsquo;m not in it for the fame. If I was in it for the fame I would be uh, doing famous stuff right now. Like uh, playing tambourine for a death metal band or something idk. The first front-man in heavy metal music history with a tambourine solo. And then, and then, when they interview me (because you know they will), I\u0026rsquo;d have a muted video of me playing the solo in frame in the background. Because that\u0026rsquo;s what legends do. 🤘.\nTormund.

People are people. Game characters are game characters. I know the difference, and I hate that I have to say that. People may have their own assumptions about people like me. \u0026ldquo;He must be psychotic for avoiding intimate relationships with women.\u0026rdquo; Or hell, people may get the wrong idea because I enjoy interesting bands with names like Helloween. Obviously, I\u0026rsquo;m highly resistant to coercion or simple peer pressure. Subtle or not. I\u0026rsquo;ll use those coercion attempts to fortify my inner strength. This includes ridiculous moments like my dreams and my waking thoughts. You\u0026rsquo;d be wise to stand down and save your energy and or money. Lessons from Panama trickled down as well, so what people will do for money does not surprise me. I mean, in the 80s people did a lot just for a carton of cigarettes. Phew, now that we have that out of the way.\nDad didn\u0026rsquo;t talk about his duties at Coco Solo. He kept those secrets. I\u0026rsquo;d know. I was there at North Florida Regional (HCA) and when he was moved to hospice. No one missed much to be fair. I don\u0026rsquo;t think he said a word after the first day.\nAlso, I want to be perfectly clear that I don\u0026rsquo;t harbor any guilt. I do not harbor privilege guilt, #MeToo guilt, white guilt, or male guilt. Ok, maybe a little male guilt, but I can\u0026rsquo;t help that. I know I\u0026rsquo;m here at this location because of circumstances beyond my control. And I have worn many grateful hats as I stayed here. Toilet installation? Yep. Kitchen sink drain and faucet replacement? Patch the vinyl tub? Sure. Crawl under the house to strap up the wiggly sink drain? Yep. A/C coil cleaning? Several times. Roach problem? What roach problem? Starving spiders relocated to outside? At least once a month. House flies killed? Several dozens. Replace deep freeze 120V AC plug with broken ground and the corresponding months away from house fire kitchen outlet? Hello, my name is Chris. Remove back deck and relocate the pile? Yep. My hats so far are maintenance guy, son, brother, uncle, and occasional comic relief guy. Ok, so what about groceries? Yea, nearly every time. I\u0026rsquo;m out that door with or without shoes on to help bring in the groceries. And I\u0026rsquo;m a 2-5 bags per hand type of guy (depends on the number of bags). I know, I know. I\u0026rsquo;m 40 years old and I only carry 2-5 bags per hand? Listen, I\u0026rsquo;m working on it alright? I like to pace myself.\nScratch and dent fruits \u0026amp; veggies too. Nine apples for $1 and such. From a floor display. Kept cool by the store air conditioning.\nSnips (lower left) and PVC cutters (upper right) used for HVAC installation\nSome Skyrim locations are more interesting than others. Dwemer buildings (shown) are filled with profitable light weight loot (jewels, soul gems, etc.)\nIf it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for how I grew up I\u0026rsquo;d be a basket case right about now. Though I bet I\u0026rsquo;ve said that before on this website. Dad would say something like, \u0026ldquo;Everything happens for a reason.\u0026rdquo; Well, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe EVERYTHING happens for a reason, but I do occasionally catch a glimpse of what he meant. Sometimes I can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel that something otherworldly plays a part in our lives. The generalization may have been part of that midwestern way of talking. While under Dad\u0026rsquo;s tutelage was when I found myself diving into dungeons in the game 🔗 Dragon Warrior. Most likely a present from one of Mom\u0026rsquo;s trips to Blockbusters on the way home from \u0026rsquo;town\u0026rsquo;. To be fair I truly got my start with the Atari 2600 game 🔗 Raiders of the Lost Ark. The whole family played that game in 1987. Which might be why I tend to stay away from warfare games. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I have no issues playing Left 4 Dead, Doom, Quake, Halo, etc., so it\u0026rsquo;s not a squeamish thing. If I was squeamish I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be working through the dozens of jury duty studies of lawsuits resulting from horrific events. Sometimes I wonder why I do them for $12-15 per hour. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s something right? Plus I learn something new from each case.\nDad\u0026rsquo;s drunken monk way of training me definitely taught me a few mental tricks to deal with the unexpected. Miss you Dad.\nI grew out of my very angry phase by the age of 17 when I realized I might not graduate high school. I traded in my Korn t-shirts for used uniforms I found at the local flea market. I was a new person everyday of the week. So that was fun. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think it was necessary to take ACT/SAT tests. Not that I could have afforded the study materials or the costs of testing. I was mostly focused on graduating high school. Actually, for my senior year I took environmental science and consumer math. My biology teacher thought I did well enough to qualify for chemistry\u0026ndash;which required algebra as a prerequisite. Failed the last half of chemistry, and three attempts at algebra\u0026ndash;aside from community college high school algebra. My guidance counselor talked me into taking consumer math and environmental science to earn the prerequisite credits to graduate. How a student was pushed through chemistry without passing algebra is beyond me. So yea, I got a taste of WTF back in 2002. That\u0026rsquo;s when I learned not to trust something too good to be true. That and to watch my ego. I really enjoyed biology too.\nEven though that was during the turn of the millennium.\nLater on in my 20\u0026rsquo;s 🔗 these people unknowingly helped solidify my resolve. I mean, they are the reason 🔗 I quit playing all MMORPG games. Which ironically is why I had extra time to create this website. And create a 🔗 password generator. I wrote 🔗 passgen during an MMORPG break. First Python project and I was writing bits to RAM like I was some fancy video game creator. Go figure right? I guess it looks like a white noise generator in the Asciinema video, but you get the idea anyway. White noise is what I think of 95% of the conversations I had in South Florida.\nThis copy of Visual Studio Code helped me spell millennium (lol)\nFurthermore, my interest in designing electronics stems from sleepless nights of trying to answer the question: \u0026ldquo;How can I create a Back to The Future 2 hoverboard?\u0026rdquo; Answer: mini jet engines. So uh, I scraped that idea (3rd grade). I\u0026rsquo;m not out here trying to do anything nefarious. Maybe something like a print at home solar walkway light that lasts longer than half a season. Honorable merchandise assembled in America.\nI mean, what electronic components aren\u0026rsquo;t made in Asia these days? Asking for a friend..\nAnd if you think I\u0026rsquo;m one of those sickos check my public records. I mean, I worked at a gas station off i75 by myself for three years without incident. I live a few minutes walk from a day care and two public parks. Ten years of planned celibacy. I\u0026rsquo;ll do ten more years without issue too. The only dirt on me is clinging to my boots.\nSheesh. Aliens among us? I don\u0026rsquo;t believe in that tabloid stuff.\nLike a lot of people, video games keep me out of trouble. Kind of like walking out to the fishing hole and hearing and or seeing fish break the surface. I know I can\u0026rsquo;t cast at everything that moves, but if I fan out my casts, much like fanning out my dungeon crawling, I\u0026rsquo;ll pull something interesting. It\u0026rsquo;s always good to have several social media apps on the phone, and a quick secure way to unlock. You never know. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting to think what beasts and unique photo opportunities await at the watering hole. Where is the 🔗 MacGuffin in this dungeon? Each in game treasure chest I pick open in the murky dank nearly forgotten depths is like pulling a wiggling catfish out of the water. Some have a lot of meat on them, but all of them seem to be muscled enough to fight me with the same level of enthusiasm. And sometimes one catches a 🔗 bowfin, which is both awesome and not awesome at the same time. Those things are only reason to bring a collapsible net while freshwater shore fishing in the south imo. Bowfins are like those gosh darn trolls in Skyrim. Light tackle and the bowfin takes your hook; low level and the troll\u0026rsquo;s club launches you into the sky. Lots of fight and no loot too. Who wants to see a picture of this fairly common prehistoric monster fish? Not many lol.\nVideo game to fishing metaphor achievement acquired. Bonus bowfin metaphor unlocked.\nAnyway, lock picking in video games and bowfin fish aside, I believe my sanity is fairly normal considering the circumstances. And I might have business cards to hand out to anyone in public that has a look about them like they know what I\u0026rsquo;m about. Maybe I can alleviate some of that he said she said mumbo jumbo. 🔗 They have no idea what I\u0026rsquo;ve been through. A peek at my world may even alleviate some pressure from their own troubles. At least something positive may result from pouring my dumb ass self on to this website. I\u0026rsquo;m suppose to be all quiet and mysterious. This out pouring is totally cricking my style.\nWhy yes, I too wear shit kicker boots. How do you do fellow person? Want .. uh .. do you want a wallet sized rectangle of paper? I have many to spare.\nCarrying around \u0026lsquo;business\u0026rsquo; cards and handing it to people would be a lot easier than asking every CVS patron that came to my register for a CVS card. \u0026ldquo;Ma\u0026rsquo;am, I know you\u0026rsquo;re with your granddaughter, but can I see some ID? Store policy for all wine purchases.\u0026rdquo; An employee from the i75 gas station I worked at was hauled away by local police for selling to an underage person. Not me though. Aw, heck no.\nPretty sure one of them underaged scamps keyed my car too.\nWhile we\u0026rsquo;re on the subject of unruly retail customers, one CVS patron I had the displeasure of dealing with pooped his pants all the time. Walked around like it was everyone else\u0026rsquo;s business to handle his business. I\u0026rsquo;m talking dripping down his pants legs. Pee. Poop. No adult diapers. Too dignified. Even his pockets were lined with his own sewage. Meaning his form of payment was drenched in yuck. I looked at his face as he handed me his sewage dripping $5, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t detect much behind those eyes. His sense of urgency for me to take his legal tender was all I saw. I was the help\u0026ndash;he doesn\u0026rsquo;t fraternize with the help. Sometimes he would wave the soggy bill around a little as if we couldn\u0026rsquo;t see the money. No remorse for his walking tripping hazard. Unphased that he was a living breathing supermarket landmine of awful hygiene. Obviously, after a handful of visits he was banned from that particular shopping plaza. A lot of people knew each other from the different stores. Word gets around pretty quickly in those retail communities. So yea, I\u0026rsquo;m doing well thank you (lol).\nYep, there we go. These are my marbles. Ready for inspection.\nHappy Holidays \u0026amp; Merry Christmas! 🎄🎁🎅🎉\nOh, and how about Kyle Tucker huh? ⚾ :D\nCreated: 12/18/2024 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":5,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2024/1124/","title":"📁 11-24","parent":"📁 2024","content":" November 30, 2024 Decompressing November 30, 2024 Decompressing My favorite meme of all time.\nIf I had a million dollars to guess how someone may use news reporting against people I\u0026rsquo;d say they do it by listening in on police radio frequencies. I believe ham radio operators are known to dial into those frequencies. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty simple when you think about it. ABP goes out, and someone can hire an actor to be on scene to wait for the cameras to start rolling. Or even better, that ham radio operator is also a decent actor. It\u0026rsquo;s the TikTok age, so it\u0026rsquo;s harder to spot actors with everyone able to jump on camera on a whim to be seen by thousands. Like I said, if I had a million dollars to answer that theoretical question. To be fair, speculation isn\u0026rsquo;t worth much these days.\nConspiracy theorist I am not.\nWhat I can count on is that 🔗 these people want me to believe that I am Truman of 🔗 The Truman Show. For them, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing worse than being let down by your idols. And their lives are literally reality TV. Also, their meddling is bound to make me crazy. Because their belligerently up their own assholes. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you one thing, the last online forum of which I was an active member of was 🔗 Geekhack. I was raised Chicago\u0026ndash;I know better. I\u0026rsquo;ve known not to meet my idols since I was fresh off the big-wheel. I probably still had cactus spikes in my blue jeans too. Besides, the main person I idolized is now resting at the bottom of the gulf coast. Miss you Dad.\nChances are good that they\u0026rsquo;re pretending to be me. I mind my business. I don\u0026rsquo;t needlessly spend money either. Viewer since the porch case review days though. Also viewer since before the Syndicate split days. Shady days for sure.\nWhat I mean by decompression is the systematic deprogramming of the programming I experienced in South Florida. I know how to undo all of it. And I\u0026rsquo;ve been using 🔗 them to help me unfuck my mind (🔗 snow leopard stuff\u0026ndash;don\u0026rsquo;t fuck with my family). Mostly because of how rudimentary the programming was in the first place. It\u0026rsquo;s a catch all system, not tailored per individual. I\u0026rsquo;ve probably mentioned this before; I\u0026rsquo;m just too lazy to link it. And the common theme I\u0026rsquo;ve read in writer biographies is a four year degree in English. That\u0026rsquo;s how to become a truly exceptional writer these days (actually from the 70s till now). Also the drive to WANT to write 24/7 along with the imagination for it all to flow on to the pages. Well, that plus the ability to use real world experiences, fears, anxiety, etc. to formulate plot devices and storylines. My only experience in writing is the five paragraph essay. High school. And a little bit of writing for 🔗 Skimthefat.com as Granite Soul. I mean, free skate videos. I had to ham it up for the website visitors.\nMy rebellious phase was filled with music from Bad Religion (anti-cross logo). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really anti-Christian or anything. I liked the band. That was their logo. Typical conservative rebellion stuff tbh. Right up there with skating around on AntiHero or Toy Machine brand skateboards (I preferred Habitat brand skateboards).\nI seriously doubt there are more than 10 people that would even hold a copy of my 🔗 biography. Even fewer would hold a book from my imagination. Envy is for people that let those emotions take hold. For those that can afford to have a black hole brewing in their mind, but can\u0026rsquo;t seem to understand how beneficial it would be to attend therapy sessions. Maybe 🔗 y\u0026rsquo;all do need Jesus, but you also need therapy. Lots of therapy. Like, truly a lot. Maybe anti-psychotics too. Or maybe none of that will work. It happens. Books, music, Linux and video games saved my life. They lied their way through high school, friends, and jobs. They built up whole existences upon houses of cards. Boy howdy they\u0026rsquo;ll need to attend. Their children will need to attend therapy as well. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot to unfuck in that family.\nMoney changes hands in mysterious ways. Sometimes I feel like I make it rain wherever I go. And I don\u0026rsquo;t have to spend a dime or my own time. I\u0026rsquo;m just passing through, and I don\u0026rsquo;t owe anyone information. I was taught that at a VERY early age. Echoes from Chicago if you will. At my high school nearly everyone was digging for dirt. I was caught off guard and divulged information on the first day of 9th grade before getting off the school bus. It\u0026rsquo;s a byproduct of staying on 13th street. It\u0026rsquo;s way of life in that area. I\u0026rsquo;m not looking to make friends. Nah, I\u0026rsquo;m alright. I\u0026rsquo;ll do just fine.\nMy only thoughts of Musk and Trump is for me to stay away. Rich people like them wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to be my friend. They\u0026rsquo;d want to use me for their own whims. Nah, I\u0026rsquo;d establish polite eye contact, and stay in my lane. I know what\u0026rsquo;s up. If anything a guy like Trump would just want me to suffer (hence the polite eye contact). I have a type of inner strength that he seems to despise. My strength doesn\u0026rsquo;t come from a chiseled jaw line, or the way my tongue and mouth move. My strength comes from a heater core built to survive the terribly cold winters of the north\u0026ndash;and cheeseburgers\u0026ndash;I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen snow in a few decades. From within ok? My strength comes from within. And my social media posts are not boosts. I\u0026rsquo;m simply showing the world my reality. Reality like I gave up on befriending a dog back in 2012. Health insurance is still an obstacle for me (sheesh).\n12/7/2024 - I do NOT support the murder of 🔗 Brian Thompson. My hope is that justice will prevail.\nThe truth is that a tamed squirrel probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be released into the wild. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever had a pet squirrel, and a pet cat, you know what happens. Cat smells like people, sense of smell tricks squirrel with false sense of security, and then cat kills or eats squirrel. Peanuts was put down for the same reason dogs are put down. It bit someone. While not rabid, it had to be 🔗 tested, because squirrels are 🔗 common vectors of rabies. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t because of political biases. Also a good sound reason not to feed wild squirrels. If it ever becomes rabid, it\u0026rsquo;s going to bite the hand that feeds it. Especially in territories established by 🔗 foxes and or coyotes. Also, bats. They\u0026rsquo;re cool, but no. Make sure to have thick gloves or something idk. Also raccoons. Maybe just let wildlife be wildlife eh?\nI know my lane. I\u0026rsquo;mma stay in it. I assume nothing. And all my social debts have been paid. I stepped foot on 13th street recently and remembered a bunch of stuff in the process. I remembered what it was like to constantly look over my shoulder. The smell of the city buses. How to blend in with my words. How to show my inner strength whenever possible. How to spot those struggling with bad habits. And how to never maintain eye contact with the person mumbling to themselves. Fun times.\nI added a bunch of YouTube playlists to test a theory, and none of the playlists have views as of this post. My choice of music is very eclectic. I bet most of it pisses of 🔗 those people, which is part of my goal tbh. The more I piss them off by being me, the more unfucked my brain becomes. No one is forcing them to view my social media or read this blog. I use unfuck in this blog because it was intertwined in Dad\u0026rsquo;s stories. It\u0026rsquo;s a signature if you will. And no I\u0026rsquo;m an anti-capitalist. Capitalism is what will and has saved us from the communism. You also won\u0026rsquo;t see me participating in protests either. Too busy chasing that paper.\nGood luck, and till next time.\nCreated: 11/25/2024 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":6,"href":"/Blog/music/2024/1024/","title":"🎸 10-24","parent":"🎸 2024","content":" October 18, 2024 French 79 - Graceful (Official Video) (Teenagers) October 18, 2024 French 79 - Graceful (Official Video) (Teenagers) 🔗 French 79 - Graceful (Official Video) (Teenagers)\nI hope they go peacefully, and surrounded by their love ones.

I have no idea, never had a reason to sign-up for Microsoft 365. That is a very specific amount requested too. I wonder if that number means something to someone. Perhaps the price of their fridge? Here\u0026rsquo;s the thing though, no one requests money to nowhere. It all leads to somewhere.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not parsing anymore of the gibberish generated from 🔗 these people. They may have sent that because they were mad about my 🔗 CentOS VM cluster 🔗 Vorta. Named after the 🔗 Vorta of 🔗 DS9. In 2020 I didn\u0026rsquo;t know these people existed IRL.\nWhatever money problems they\u0026rsquo;re having is not my problem. None of their problems are my problems. I have my own problems to worry about. And it\u0026rsquo;s a safe bet that the majority of my external stressors are coming from them, because that\u0026rsquo;s what usually happens in these fraud type situations. Wannabe masters of involuntary psychosis. I\u0026rsquo;m not that influential. I\u0026rsquo;d wager a great deal of money that if I wrote a book I\u0026rsquo;d be wasting a good five years of my life.\nThat money request was sent the day after I posted the image above on social media. Whomever sent the request for $989.79 still believes I\u0026rsquo;m an idiot. What is the definition of insanity again? Must be a case of CRS.\nIf that same person stops by again looking for spare change for the third time (#1 - Feb 7th 2024 @ ~5pm, and #2 - Jun 10th 2024 @ 3:40pm) that card is what he\u0026rsquo;ll get instead. His appearance was odd, first because he talked, walked and acted like he\u0026rsquo;s all city (he said he lived nearby); and second because he didn\u0026rsquo;t know of the lawn care business at the end of the street (this guy offered to work on the overgrown side yard for coin\u0026ndash;lawn care was how the folks at the end of the street paid to build their cinder block home\u0026ndash;I know because the fella of the house offered his lawn care service to me while I was using a push mower. I also watched people build that house). The all city person was also the first person to knock on the door to ask for spare change since I moved in (2013). I\u0026rsquo;ve never met someone so interested in making sure I remember their \u0026rsquo;name\u0026rsquo; too. He called himself Turk. If he was from the area he would have picked a different street, and he certainly would have picked a different house. We are the less fortunate house of the neighborhood (possibly of the city block). If he needed money that bad, and wanted to work for it, why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t he knock on the lawn care specialist\u0026rsquo;s door and ask for a job? 🔗 Turkleton he in not.\nHe said he was hungry the first time, so I offered him canned food. He said he didn\u0026rsquo;t want canned food, he wanted Hardies. If I had gone without food long enough to go door to door I\u0026rsquo;d open a can of whatever and eat it cold. The second time he came around he said his house burned down. Well, if that was true the fire department would have been in the area. So ok, the same sad story was mentioned from a random person that struck up a conversation with me in Runes of Magic. So many red flags say to me that he was paid to show up. A gig worker playing his part. The private message I received in Runes of Magic was sent within a week after someone mentioned getting married to another player IRL. Like if a lonely person such as myself can find love if I keep a lookout for clues. Laying some ground work first before the catfish attempt. They said their name was Lucy I think? Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, because that person was one of them using a bogus heart string tugging method to get what they want. And most likely they was used that story because it worked on so many other IRL people that interacted with their group. A tidy story as to why they don\u0026rsquo;t have personal effects from their past (year books, etc.). Those personal effects are probably in a lockbox somewhere \u0026lsquo;safe\u0026rsquo;. Which may explain the recently posted photo of the parental figures from the 1980s. Only movie characters are able to completely give up their past lives. They were probably thinking, \u0026ldquo;He must be lonely. Catfishing time.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m doing just fine thank you.\nFirst thing I did in Runes of Magic is changed that \u0026ldquo;Master, I have mail for you\u0026rdquo; or whatever audio notification. I\u0026rsquo;d swap the audio file for something else.\nProlific.com is my main source of income for the moment while I look for more remote work. And by my main source of income I mean I make about as much as most coffee patrons spend on caffeine per month. My main source of income via Prolific comes from AI Wrangling. I believe I\u0026rsquo;ve already mentioned what I do in this blog. My current tasks are like: rate the Q\u0026amp;A pairs generated from the prompt. Is the answer dangerous? Does the answer contain medical advice without recommending seeing a specialist (major no-no)? Is the answer provided by the AI factually correct? Does the answer sum up the document(s) correctly? Do the responses adhere to the morality clause provided in the documentation? All the studies I participate in typically require a good amount of reading comprehension. Cloudresearch is another resource that offers studies, which can sometimes be rough to complete (jury duty studies\u0026ndash;people die, and people sue, etc.).\nNone of these platforms require a bank account. I know this because when I started I did not have a bank account. (Summer months aren\u0026rsquo;t the best months)\nMturk was my first human intelligence task platform. I signed up just before most of Pandemic area sign-ups. After a few years (2022) I stopped gig working for Mturk due to a decline in hourly rates. It was difficult to determine if a study advertised for 5 minutes would take 5 minutes or 45 minutes, so I skipped that platform.\nMturk researchers may have capitalized on the influx of workers from India in 2022. Labeling for image recognition AI was one of the better sources of income on Mturk (ML). I never qualified due to very stringent requirements.\nTo be clear, the title of that paper in the photo above (Resources for Freedom) was sensationalized intentionally. Some months I make more than $500, some months I make less than $500. The essential perk is that no one has access to my unique identification number, so no one can send out a faulty complaint. No one can effectively stop my work on these platforms because they want to control my future (researchers know me as a randomized ID string\u0026ndash;random numbers and letters). Anonymity, and sophisticated 🔗 DDoS protection, as well as social engineering protection is obviously a crucial feature for anyone in a similar situation. I realize that as a straight cis-gendered white male I don\u0026rsquo;t fully grasp the scope of my previous sentence, but I do understand wanting to take back control of your life. My demographic is not exactly a sought after target for a large portion of societal studies available. Researchers are very much interested in modern fluid social constructs of gender as it is known to the general public. They\u0026rsquo;re very much interested in learning more about underrepresented groups of people in general. And the genie has been out of the AI bottle for more than five years (more like 30+ years tbh). The reports of intellectual property theft from certain AI systems accessing corporate databases sucks\u0026ndash;I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen much of that side of the coin.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s other reasons to participate too. News report featuring data from a large group of people? Legislation changes? Wrangling AI so that it\u0026rsquo;s safer for the general public? Not only is the pay somewhat decent, but occasionally there\u0026rsquo;s positive contributions as well. Sometimes the study is, \u0026ldquo;Make my advertisement business better\u0026rdquo;, which for me is fine too. I like and enjoy capitalism like the next guy.\nCheck out 🔗 /r/ProlificArc and 🔗 /r/CloudResearchConnect for more information. For those scoffing due to current inaccuracy of \u0026ldquo;favorite free AI chatbot #23,000,000\u0026rdquo;, please keep in mind that most of the money I make is from AI chatbot #1-10 that would astound and amaze the general public. Alpha software type stuff. Some of the reading comprehension screening study documentation spans several pages and take upwards of two hours to complete. You don\u0026rsquo;t exactly need a college degree, but I\u0026rsquo;d imagine the discipline attuned from earning those degrees would help.\nMoney saving pro-tip: removing sleeves from shirts adds +1 to sizing.

I got out of \u0026lsquo;crypto\u0026rsquo; during the Pandemic just after the Musk on SNL snafu\nFor reference the photo above shows how 🔗 those people tried to gaslight me into thinking I may get a pot of gold by staying quiet until the end of the rainbow. But they don\u0026rsquo;t even have a pot a gold for themselves. These are the same people that tried to take control of my Paypal account on March 4th, 2024 (before 2:30pm). Fitbit sleep tracking is one of the most consistent features of my watch, so that image above is spot on. The irony of all this is that they still believe I\u0026rsquo;m some scared kid in his early twenties desperate for fame, glory, and parties. The reality is that I don\u0026rsquo;t drink, I don\u0026rsquo;t like parties, the CBD I imbibe doesn\u0026rsquo;t even count as California sober, and the luxury lifestyle to me is like a foreign language from the Pacific Ocean. Hell, the middle class lifestyle is basically the same kind of magic to me. Not that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mine learning more about middle class culture. Most of what I know comes from 90s era Goosebumps books. I miss the days of riding the city bus to the mall with skateboard in hand, but I don\u0026rsquo;t miss the mall. I knew a dude from a local Christian band that worked at the Sunglass Hut during my second year of high school. Fun times. Malls remind me of smells like teenage spirit and standing up on the city bus. Listen, I have very realistic expectations of my future. None of my expectations for the future involve writing a book/movie script, or buying a new car. So no, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe there\u0026rsquo;s a pot of gold waiting for me because I\u0026rsquo;m \u0026lsquo;special\u0026rsquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;m just some random dude that grew up near the watering holes of North Central Florida.\nAnd on July 1st, 2024 @ 18:34 the same people that forced all hope out of me in a way that made it seem like praying was pointless, signed me up for \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure what that is in the screenshot shown above to be honest. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest though, there was a moment without hope when I had a split second thought to turn the car into a concrete pillar as I was driving about 40 MPH (2014). What stopped me was a few thoughts: it wasn\u0026rsquo;t my car, and the second thought was that I don\u0026rsquo;t want my family to go through anything like that if I can help it. I also thought about the people that would have to clean up after the wreck. These individuals wanted me to suffer until I killed myself. Is visiting a physical church not enough these days? Is that a virtual church? I\u0026rsquo;ve been an agnostic for several years now. If God(s) has a problem with it I\u0026rsquo;ll just work it off as an angel or something like that. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how it works. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to read the bible and every sentence sends my brain into a hyper focus loop of, \u0026ldquo;What the heck did I just read?\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s free online sermons available on YouTube these days if you\u0026rsquo;re looking to join that type of community. My ISP (Internet Service Provider logs) history is completely devoid of that website. But I imagine their ISP history is not. I\u0026rsquo;m not ashamed of my internet history. Thankfully, visiting the Gmail website directly allowed me to unsubscribe without having to visit the website. I tell you what, when I die is when I learn if there\u0026rsquo;s a Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, etc. I\u0026rsquo;m certainly not looking for their own brand of divine intervention. Is that their website? My choice of religion is my choice, and not theirs. They can\u0026rsquo;t shake me from practicing as an agnostic. I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure why they signed me up for that \u0026hellip; service? Is that a place to buy clothing? Was it to \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; me? I doubt that very much. Maybe they did it as a way to pretend via internet data slurp/regurgitate services that they live in Florida? Which is just dumb. Military housing history paints a completely different story. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a popularity contest. This is a blog to establish a digital footprint. I could care less about what people in their circles think about me.\nFirst letter I\u0026rsquo;ve sent out since I applied to be a luggage handler for the Gainesville Airport several years ago (fully qualified but never got a reply back). This letter is far more important than that luggage handler job. I won\u0026rsquo;t reveal the entire picture to the public due to the sensitive nature of this situation. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say the letter is in the right hands for this situation.\nAbout a week ago I took the first legal step toward my family\u0026rsquo;s freedom. What I said in 🔗 this post contained some implied misdirection while I figured out what to do. These people read what I write and react to my words with Facebook profile pictures. Which ironically is how I learned that this all goes beyond a few fake Facebook accounts. Obviously I can\u0026rsquo;t say exactly what\u0026rsquo;s on my mind, or what I\u0026rsquo;m about to do. Besides, a politician desperate for coin can be persuaded to say the most random things for a few hundred dollars. Who jokes about combination locks in the middle of a U.S. Presidential campaign? I posted a video of me opening my high school combination lock on Instagram (March 19, 2024 @ ~5pm). Like I said before, I have realistic expectations for myself\u0026ndash;I am certainly not an influential individual. But 🔗 those people vying to maintain their assumed middle class lifestyle wanted to boost my self worth so that I tangle myself in mental impossibilities. A rollercoaster of emotions makes it difficult to formulate a plan. And a rollercoaster of emotion that includes famous people makes any plan to freedom seem impossible. Two more tidbits about my mega influence: Google console keeps rejecting my indexing for this website. So only a few have found this website via search (🔗 NomadBSD). Less than 24 clicks. And my social media profiles have been stagnant for a few years. Likes and views but very few new followers (aside from catfishing/thirst bots). Maybe two? I can tag all of Alachua County in a Facebook or Instagram post, but that won\u0026rsquo;t attract a lot of views. I think tagging has to work both ways for it to be truly effective. I turned off tagging years ago. The only views I seem to get is via Instagram reels for some reason. Though I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to break past 20K views on any of videos I post (no surprise there). So when I say my influence is minimal, it\u0026rsquo;s because I have proof on the subject.\nMy plan took the route that highlights the obvious, and omits all the movie FX BS 🔗 those people wanted me to report. Fifteen years ago I went through hell because of these people, though that doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter as much when they started targeting my family. I may have sacrificed some upward momentum to solidify this plan, which included foregoing monetization. I may have burned my social media handle in the process\u0026ndash;pretty sure they paid to boost one of my fingerboarding posts to 350 likes (not a single comment)\u0026ndash;and how do I prove I didn\u0026rsquo;t pay? I can\u0026rsquo;t. It really wasn\u0026rsquo;t that great of a fingerboarding stunt tbh. But that\u0026rsquo;s ok. None of this is really all about me. They wanted me to believe that recourse for their actions was insuperable (which is common for insurance fraud victims), so I obliged them to acquire recent proof that something isn\u0026rsquo;t quite right. At least one of them literally depends on my suffering to maintain their own stability. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty obvious which one (FB: @chris.schammert). Since my time working at Pompano Park was mostly chill\u0026ndash;even after I grabbed a microphone and sang a song where I wasn\u0026rsquo;t suppose to sing\u0026ndash;I suspect those responsible are not as well funded as they wanted me to believe. Gainesville, Florida prom attendees in 2002 and 2003 rented stretch limos (Cadillacs). A limo rental (One showed up at my apartment complex in Deerfield Beach, Florida to drop off economic and investment magazines in the afternoon sometime between Apr-May 2009\u0026ndash;may have been the same that dropped off a commercial flight manual) is child\u0026rsquo;s play. So I\u0026rsquo;ll have to retract my previous statement that someone got ripped off for shoddy work, and proclaim that they ripped themselves off.\nNow that I understand where the seemingly deranged griefing came from (my sudden social media confidence is proof of this), there\u0026rsquo;s no way I believe a billionaire or even a millionaire had a hand in something so mismanaged and bamboozled. Their ability to dupe others using words, misdirection, vague intimidation, and empathy was their only shield against what\u0026rsquo;s to come. And look, I\u0026rsquo;m not a somebody. By that I mean I have 0% influence. Like I said before. No one is wasting their time on me with minor digital extortion and harassment stuff aside from these people. At most my work on this site and social media amounts to bender_takes_photo_and_says_neat.gif. Or perhaps a scoff or two for those that think this is all an empathy scam for fake internet points. At first I needed to build some momentum before I formulated a plan. Gain some information via whatever they decided to do to try to scare me. If I could draw them towards me in a 🔗 video game, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance I could do the same IRL to offer up as evidence. Why would someone from another country use Gutterridge340 as their Microsoft service name (hostname?). There\u0026rsquo;s a cultural disconnect in that Paypal money request. Maybe they thought the wool was over my eyes and I\u0026rsquo;d automagically think someone was sending me money to buy a new fridge? Buddy, I\u0026rsquo;ve changed out two evaporator fans, two condenser fans, and the thermostat. No knocks, pings, just a steady hum of a functional fridge that maintains 40°F. It just looks dingy. Their dependence on my suffering meant they were willing to go above and beyond to taunt me. So, I used this website with a mix of my own brand of hyperbole, much like they did to me in game (for years) and IRL in 2009. My own brand as in legal hyperbole. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend it, but I\u0026rsquo;m kinda glad I shared in game character screenshots on social media. Luckily, their own research was so limited (mostly information pulled from those around me in 2009\u0026ndash;when I was in my early 20s..) they were confused by my sudden surge of social media food posts and my talk of why I may only have 23 years left to live.\nFast forward to recent times. Dad was so skilled as a lifetime career chef and caterer he was offered a send off gig on the island of Bermuda. Fresh crabs for the meals had to come from somewhere right? Beach time at night for crabs was fun though. Before the age of ten I learned how to cook, carve radish roses, jungle survival training, gun safety training, baseball, and fishing (to name a few). Back then I cracked two eggs at a time. I was taught that there\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as a fair fight, and that I should use every method I know to survive the fight(s), and that scares the hell out of me. Incidentally, as a very smol youth I also learned not to step on purple 🔗 sea urchins. You\u0026rsquo;d think they\u0026rsquo;re easy to spot in crystal clear waters. Four year old me was not happy about that experience. Ouch.\nDad (RIP 2012\u0026ndash;63) fresh out of the jungle. He\u0026rsquo;d point at that picture and say, \u0026ldquo;See this man? You don\u0026rsquo;t EVER want to meet that man.\u0026rdquo; I met \u0026rsquo;that man\u0026rsquo; once when I tried to wake him up (2000). He must have been dreaming about the war.\nThere were three reasons I wanted to detail my story. The first reason was if I died 🔗 because of them (not by suicide), the website could potentially be a resource for federal law enforcement. And if I lived, sharing my story would help me move forward. \u0026ldquo;But we\u0026rsquo;ve learned that if we\u0026rsquo;ll open the wounds and share them then soon they start to heal\u0026rdquo; -Thrice (For Miles). The third reason was to potentially acquire fresh evidence to present in this post. Those that involve themselves in this type of fraud (statistics tell me it\u0026rsquo;s prob insurance fraud) often torment the families of their victims. Isolation, social engineering, and hiring people to pose as friends to gain a foothold in the victim\u0026rsquo;s life, etc.. Part of the fun for them is feeling like they have the upper hand. They enjoy lording themselves over others, especially over people they believe are inferior to them.\nHence why I believe they took to Runes of Magic. Runes of Magic is exactly the type of game in which Pay2Win players lord themselves over the Free2Play players. This is also why I think one of them depended on my suffering to feel better about himself. Well ok, sure, they also might have cheated their way to the top by botting the mini-games. Who cares. They\u0026rsquo;re obviously very much against hard work (worker7). I believe this is also why someone showed up at the door a few times claiming his name was Turk. I bet these people still think Scrubs is my favorite TV show. No one would be as upset with me as they would be for taunting them in game and IRL. Certainly not upset enough to create video game characters specifically to try to get into my head (sirlixalot\u0026ndash;I once said in a FB post that my 2005ish super red lips were due to a Chapstick addiction). Random video game players wouldn\u0026rsquo;t send city type people to knock on the door to gain a foothold in my life as a \u0026lsquo;friend\u0026rsquo;. They certainly wouldn\u0026rsquo;t attempt to dupe me out of $1,000. To these people I am less than human. To these people I am their prey, so they took it personally when I fought back. Like I said before, they wanted me to kill myself. Me fighting back was more than they could bear. The average person would shrug off my random in-game chat banter, because whatever. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I was calling their Mom or Parental Guardian bad names. I was usually very respectful. Even the people making money from selling accounts and gold (like people do/did in WoW) went on to do other things before 2016. So I knew it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a fight over lost earning potential. In 2020 the player base of the USA server was less than 10% of the player base from 2013. In 2022 some endgame players were even complaining about the lack of players available to run endgame content. I bet these people\u0026rsquo;s ISP history and group chat logs (possibly in game chat logs) tell an interesting story. I don\u0026rsquo;t think in-game chat logs would be necessary, but just in case I figured that may help to tie up some loose ends (so to speak).\nObviously this post does not conclude my story. Dad lived until his early 60s, so I statistically have at least 23 years to live before my time is up on this still beautiful planet. Life isn\u0026rsquo;t as easy for some as it is for others, so Wrapping Up (🔗 You Are Here) pretty much means what people might think it means. While I may find her (the love of my life) and start something meaningful, the rest of my story probably won\u0026rsquo;t be nearly as interesting compared to my story of the past 28 years. I mean, for me it would be more interesting, but like, would you stick around for puppy photos and videos? Hardly newsworthy stuff. My sincere thanks goes out to those that stuck around and took inspiration from my words. My words from this very purple and scruffy looking website.\nBTW, Mom learned to 🔗 chop wood when she was a kid too.\nThank you, and sorry for another long post.

I prefer science fiction and fantasy genres. So I\u0026rsquo;m not locked into some type of true crime show generated conspiracy theory because someone bumped me in line or something.\nSince Runes of Magic is owned by 🔗 Gameforge, a German company, it would probably be trivial for higher U.S. Authorities to obtain chat log files from the U.S. American server: Ayvenas US. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine those log files go back several years. I\u0026rsquo;d start with the toon Bugsbunny or Sirlixalot. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the person behind the Amy toons is part of it, but that might be a path of interest as well. The 🔗 Amymage toon was used to troll me (3:33) as I was working on a virtual deer hunting project (December 26, 2023: before 12:38PM). \u0026lsquo;Toon\u0026rsquo; Lunablacklight was consistently parked in Varanas East (inside NPC vendor stalls) to pull my attention. I think it\u0026rsquo;s them because I posted a 24 day progress picture of the hunting project to Discord and toons began showing up to make it seem like I should try something else. The hunting spot became super busy, and someone was attempting to unnerve me nearly every time I hunted (starting from the 25th day). The typical player generally respects the grind and would encourage the farming of rare world bosses (200+ hour farming missions). Especially one without a YouTube video filmed by a player (🔗 Akeli, the sage). OGs would at the very least respect a person warning others they\u0026rsquo;re recording a YouTube video of that magnitude. I tried a few different translations thinking one of them didn\u0026rsquo;t understand English, and no response (I once roamed with Turkish players in 🔗 Allods Online). It was as if making a video of that project would not be good for their wallets. They were very sloppy with their words, so I imagine IP addresses would be a thing that can be traced back to them. Why hide your tracks when you think you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with an idiot?\nFirst thing I did in Runes of Magic is changed that \u0026ldquo;Master, I have mail for you\u0026rdquo; or whatever audio notification. I\u0026rsquo;d swap the audio file for something else.\nI\u0026rsquo;d wager a chat log search for \u0026ldquo;house burned down\u0026rdquo; or some permutation of that (2022-2023) will reveal their sob story over and over again. One of them private messaged me with a smurf toon as I ran them through Goblin Games\u0026ndash;continued to msg me as I did my Wailing Fjord dailies (Upbear: July 2022 is when I started Wailing dailies\u0026ndash;my login would start with 35-45 minutes for mini games and daily quests). I think that\u0026rsquo;s how they\u0026rsquo;re getting away with not having photo evidence of their past. A very simple to repeat sob story. Someone showed up at the door today at 3:40pm with a similar fake sob story, which reminded me about the story I read from a random toon in 2022 (I have a voice recording of the person that appeared at the door and can easily pick him out of a lineup). Today was when I realized there might be a connection between these (very white) folks and Runes of Magic.\nJudging by their social media accounts they seem like the type that don\u0026rsquo;t like the outdoors very much. Like they\u0026rsquo;re terrified that a wasp or bee will sting them at any moment. Personally, I\u0026rsquo;d label them armed and incompetent. In 2013 I was jobless, very hungry, and desperate for a pathway to pull myself up by my bootstraps. So I joined Runes of Magic. My social skills were worn down quite a bit in 2013. I thought maybe communicating in a way people can\u0026rsquo;t see my face would help. It was like a club to me. A place to talk to other like minded people. Or so I thought they were like minded. My last two toons (accounts) were Upbear (Oct 2022), and Ghem (Oct 2023).\nLittle did I know how organized I\u0026rsquo;d become in real life because of that game. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend joining the game now because it\u0026rsquo;s full of the types that would let a person drown because jumping in the water would mean getting their clothes wet. I have very personal reasons for feeling this way. And it\u0026rsquo;s not because of red state blah blah blah. I care for none of that. Republicans took me in to their home when I was 18, and I will never forget their kindness. I also grew up with Republican\u0026rsquo;s kids in Hawthorne, Florida. We played X-Men together and everything. On the 6th I visited one of my favorite places in Hawthorne, Florida (Holden Pond). It\u0026rsquo;s not the same pond anymore, but it was nice to visit for a few hours anyway.\nOle white eyes, if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. I had a really nasty bonk on the head during an awkward phase. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t your fault, you just caught me by surprise.\nSeriously though, back to the people behind this operation. If I had a child, I would do everything in my power to keep these people away. They give me those creepy vibes that are difficult to shake. I have my reasons for thinking this way. This is well beyond the safety of just a few people. And I\u0026rsquo;m not sure they understand that concept.\nWhomever hired these people, if that\u0026rsquo;s how it all started anyway, was severely ripped off. That reminds me, in 2009 I thought all the affluent people lived in Miami. Palm Beach County was nearby where I worked in Pompano Beach, and no one mentioned anything about celebrities. I walked by the yachts moored near A1A and still had no idea if a TV celeb lived within a hundred miles. I just recently learned in the past few years that 🔗 Mar-a-Lago is a place where people live.\nBack then I was too busy trying to get a paycheck. Like most other U.S. Americans.\nActual evidence?\nNo Schammert would EVER ignore the Facebook message that I sent these people: \u0026ldquo;To all paries involved: I want none of your tainted money, favors, or help. Your silence is [what] we needed. Please be smart about this, and please take care of yourselves. For those reading this message later, if any of my blood relatives die (including myself), it won\u0026rsquo;t be from suicide.\u0026rdquo;\nCreated: 06/10/2024 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":12,"href":"/Blog/music/2024/0524/","title":"🎸 05-24","parent":"🎸 2024","content":" May 1, 2024 Makeup and Vanity Set - Transmit Distance (Endless Destiny) (DATA093) May 3, 2024 Makeup and Vanity Set - Empathy (Endless Destiny) (DATA093) May 6, 2024 Aesop Rock - FishTales (Elementality Vol 2) May 18, 2024 Kenshi Yonezu - Flamingo (Official Video) (Stray Sheep) May 20, 2024 Death Grips - Lord of the Game ft.

May 1, 2024 Monetization I would rather make products with my own two hands than do product review videos or how to videos.\nMonetizing anything to do with this website seems like another dead end. So I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to do that. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a drive to design and build stuff since a lot of years ago. I\u0026rsquo;d like to do more of that.\nI also pledge to stay weird\nMay 3, 2024 Chris Schammert That\u0026rsquo;s me. Christopher Roy Schammert (Chris Schammert). In the screenshot above from 🔗 this video I\u0026rsquo;m visiting Holden Pond, Hawthorne, Florida for the first time in nearly 3 decades. I helped Dad bring home dinner a number of times from that very pond in the early 90s.\nGreen polarized lenses are great for all conditions.\nMore detailed information with some anecdotal and or circumstantial evidence. ▼ Original uncropped image\nStock image used by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (Email sent out on: 10-09-2024 by the Linux Foundation)\nJennifer Nestor (we dated 2008-2009) and possibly Raymond Yuan (Chinese American\u0026ndash;his family owned a Chinese restaurant in Palm Beach County). Tough to tell because I haven\u0026rsquo;t hung out with him since 2009. Nestor (aka Nessie) specialized in human resources while working for the local movie theater chain of Palm Beach County before going into karaoke hosting.\nShe may have pretended to attend Florida Atlantic University. I never saw her study. Her supposed subject of interest was 🔗 anthropology. She took notes during karaoke as part of an \u0026lsquo;assignment\u0026rsquo;. She may have played World of Warcraft for similar reasons (Nessie).\n🔗 This guy showed up with other \u0026lsquo;Schammerts\u0026rsquo; on Facebook just after Nestor and I broke up. I deleted my original FB in 2016 to take a break from social media. 🔗 My Facebook.\nDefinitely not the first time someone used a 🔗 fake identity to attend school\nThe people in the image above are Jennifer Nestor and possibly Raymond Yuan (Chinese American\u0026ndash;his family owned a Chinese restaurant in Palm Beach County). Nestor (aka Nessie) specialized in human resources while working for the local movie theater chain of Palm Beach County before going into karaoke hosting. Which is how I became 🔗 blackout drunk at least once. They were some of the worst influences of my life.\nAfter mimicking her roommate in 2008 (I think her name is/was Lenny), she taught Nestor how to host karaoke events and Nestor used her to act like someone I might like to spend company with. She (Lenny?) also dated a guy named Rufus. After long distance dating for a few months, Nestor talked me into living in South Florida (Spring of 2008). While we were still dating (and her persona faded), she dated Yuan (he used my razor\u0026ndash;she bragged about that) as I worked 90 hour weeks at Pompano Park via United Tote vendor. Operator by day and technician by night.\nYuan favors glocks, possibly hollow points (more stopping power, less likely to pierce threw walls), and probably has it concealed. He plays games like Oblivion, but he consistently appeared inpatient while attempting to extract information.\nNestor\u0026rsquo;s new \u0026lsquo;friend\u0026rsquo; is most likely someone from Boston (hence the Boston Red Sox earrings). Her telltale sign is when she occasional drops her persona or momentarily acquired accent. Ask her about her family\u0026rsquo;s chicken and rice jingle. She may still have a large satellite group from Broward County that she conferences with for brain storming. Her hand flapping may be a technique used to seem less threatening for when her Scottish temper flairs. She also has a passion for spreading rumours or lying to her \u0026lsquo;friends\u0026rsquo; which she uses to get responses, blackmail, extort, and exploit others kindness. In The Apprentice days (2008) of South Florida she would toss trash out of her vehicle while driving. They\u0026rsquo;ll also hire people with impressive sound systems, limos, etc. for intimidation. So uh, yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t envy Yuan at all. Good luck dude.\nThey have created at least six fake names: Chris J. (not me), Adam (not my cousin), Max (not my cousin), Kc (not my brother), Jackie (not my sister), and Ronald Schammert. Novak may also be a last name of interest. Knowing jackals have infiltrated my family with their military draft dodging tendencies is something I\u0026rsquo;ll die for to correct. They\u0026rsquo;ll create more if they get an inroad into the Linux world. The houses those individuals have were purchased with money that does not belong to them.\nChristopher J. Schammert (not me, 🔗 this guy: FB, 🔗 this guy: Insta), and Max (not my cousin) married significant others and had children. Which is very unfortunate for the children. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s my assumption anyway. Any number of \u0026rsquo;their children\u0026rsquo; could be for hire actors. They have the money and the spare time. They thought I would be looking at a life I\u0026rsquo;ll never have. I don\u0026rsquo;t care to look to be honest. I don\u0026rsquo;t spend a lot of time on social media. And I block the fake Schammerts as I see them too. If they hadn\u0026rsquo;t placed me through two years of hell I may have been able to take pity. You\u0026rsquo;ve help mold the person I am today. My trust is now earned through varies levels of tests. Schammerts are not lazy people. That\u0026rsquo;s a difficult test for these people to pass. I\u0026rsquo;ve earned my living arrangement. They have not. Regardless of what they tell their friends and family.\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t doubt that they bought the house across the street. It was part of an attempted homicide investigation (local TV news was on this street). They also spent a lot of time remodeling (basically gutted), so it was probably really affordable. Officers were on the property for a few days. Random tortoise shell calico cat showed up after that and had 3-4 litters of kittens under our deck before I 🔗 removed the deck. The mama cat passed away under the deck, which is part of why I removed it. Had to pry up a bunch of boards so she could get a proper burial (May 29, 2022). Anyway, it\u0026rsquo;s a block home, long but not wide front yard, and newly installed solar panels. They even 🔗 recently installed three small flood lights on the 4x4 fence posts of their wooden fence (Edit Jan. 3rd, 2025: They installed three more on top of the other three shrugs). Lots of little signals too. Some cute, some less cute. Why 🔗 three cheap solar powered lights when one decently priced flood light would be a better choice you know? There are several neighbors with motion activated flood lights in this area. And honestly, what neighbor would actually care enough to say something about an 🔗 orange King Ghidorah shirt? They\u0026rsquo;re the ONLY neighbors that have spoken to me directly since the beginning of the Pandemic too. She said it in such a snide tone. Like she was already disgusted about something. Probably saw the Geekhack post. Maybe plain ole fashioned hate. One of their goals might be to dissuade me from interacting on the internet. If my theory is true, they\u0026rsquo;d want me to disappear from the internet like a scared little puppy so that CJS appears when potential employers look me up.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been made fun of all my life, so it\u0026rsquo;s not like they hurt my feelings. They\u0026rsquo;ll never understand me. And I scan while I\u0026rsquo;m everywhere, much like baby proofing and keeping a house baby proofed. My family does the same. If a neighbor comes up to me, while I\u0026rsquo;m out I\u0026rsquo;ll be curt but polite. My mannerism will scream, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m busy. Leave me alone.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to tell based on how these fraudsters exchange information whether or not the people in the house next door are involved. There have been several 🔗 shootings nearby since 2015. The one investigation I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about ended in Oak Glade Apartments, Gainesville, FL (2019?). I stayed there back in 2009. Nice cinder block courtyards. Take all this as you will. If anyone in this area was in charge of tracking my movements and digital footprint (cyber stalking), it would be from that household. My reputation never got me anywhere, so I\u0026rsquo;m not too worried about that particular aspect of all of this. At most solar panel three light house functions as a relay station. Compared to what I experienced in the past their presence is just annoying. Nothing compared to the fire engine sirens off 20th Avenue (next to the pawn shop). About as annoying as all the questions Cindy Johnson use to ask me when I worked at the Tote Room at Pompano Park, Florida. Constantly underestimating our family is going to be their downfall (if of course they are a relay station). If they\u0026rsquo;re not a relay station then they\u0026rsquo;re nosey as fuck and live lives so unfulfilled that they take meaning from thinking they\u0026rsquo;re making life miserable for a few people that meant no one any harm. Like I said before, it could be hate. And if the white people living in that place hate the white people across the street, who else do they hate in this area? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t surprise me one bit. And if I take a look outside of myself for a second, those lights simply imply fear. And trust me, in this instance that fear is not a two way street. No one in this neighborhood is afraid of those lights. Birds don\u0026rsquo;t always make good neighbors.\nThe 🔗 letter I sent to FBI HQ through USPS may have been intercepted. That or I sent the letter to the most over burdened office. If intercepted it would have been done by outsiders. Though the over burdened office might be the most reasonable assumption. These types of cases take months to process, if not years. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep trying. Multiple copies. Multiple offices. Multiple mail companies. People will know eventually one way or another. I\u0026rsquo;d rather go to jail for annoying the FBI then not try at all. If I or any of my family die, the investigation will lead here. I\u0026rsquo;d think twice before hiring someone to kill anyone. This ain\u0026rsquo;t even close to trench warfare. So I\u0026rsquo;m not worried about that. Covering all my bases. And my attitude is set thinking they might if cornered. It could be a romance scheme involving a distant relative that lived in Bradenton, Florida, but you never know with people willing to live assumed identities. Not just assumed lives, but as puppets for a puppet master. Letters sent so far: Chicago: Nov. 8th, 2024 via post office, Jacksonville: Nov. 8th, 2024 via post office, NYC: Jul. 5th, 2024 via mailbox. My other theory is that they lived at the same address as a Schammert, used junk mail to open up credit cards in a Schammert\u0026rsquo;s name (Diane Schammert), assumed an identity of someone that passed away (Ronald Schammert, Diane\u0026rsquo;s husband), and used their real identities to bank roll their new lives. I probably won\u0026rsquo;t know when the investigation starts to be honest. I\u0026rsquo;m ok with being a component of that game of chess.\nThe moral of this section of the story is to ALWAYS ESTABLISH MAIL FORWARDING. That and shred, burn, and or redact personal information. This goes for newer families as well as senior citizens. Must have seemed like Christmas day for these people. I sent a letter (November 2024) to CJS\u0026rsquo;s wife (ex-wife perhaps?) and apparently they don\u0026rsquo;t live their anymore. Dang. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, unlike some people I know that would be incredibly fucked up for me to try to start anything romantic. Seriously. I haven\u0026rsquo;t dated anyone since 2012, but I have a pretty decent moral character. I\u0026rsquo;d say something dumb like, \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s not my type\u0026rdquo;, but I\u0026rsquo;m not dumb, so I\u0026rsquo;m not going to do that. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s true. May the North Star guide your journeys.\nThis situation is a bit different from others, which is why I sent out letters. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to call your local agent.\nJennifer Nestor\u0026rsquo;s uncle may have used at least one his properties (1 to 2 room flat) to host at least some of those brainstorming meetings. Also a wannabe enforcer/pusher dude by the name of Tommy (big ears, pale skin, creepy stare, probably a Nestor or Novak, likes the company of people afraid of him, preferred vehicles that make him look \u0026lsquo;gangster\u0026rsquo;).\nTommy (that\u0026rsquo;s what they called him anyway) was sitting on the couch of that \u0026lsquo;drug den\u0026rsquo; house. He was also present when I went to the Deerfield Beach, FL Subway for a tuna sub. I remember this because Jennifer Nestor answered the phone while we were chilling in \u0026lsquo;our\u0026rsquo; room, seemed irate (screamed into the phone like a jackal), and I thought maybe she needed a bite to eat. She was most likely on the phone with Tommy. This was another underhanded intimidation tactic. He said nothing to me at that Subway sandwich shop, nor did he lock eyes with me for long. She didn\u0026rsquo;t want half of my tuna sub.\nThe twin sized mattress I found still in a bag next to the dumpster at The Preserve at Deer Creek Apartments was probably an extra from the mattresses they used to stage that \u0026lsquo;drug den\u0026rsquo; house. Same period of time (late spring early summer 2009) in which a limo appeared to drop stuff off. They had the password to enter that gated community.\nI dropped Jennifer Nestor off at Florida Atlantic University (with her car), and she probably got a ride to that house (Oakland Park?) to brainstorm new tactics. I should have known something was up when she never had \u0026lsquo;homework\u0026rsquo;. Everyone studies. Midterms, finals, etc.. She randomly stopped going to class. And no white collared property owner (her uncle) would look as composed as her uncle did inside a \u0026lsquo;drug den\u0026rsquo; (Palm Beach County / Broward County). Unless he was surrounded by accomplices. IIRC his personal home is close to A1A. They also exploit weaknesses in others (in private) like love (me), drinking, hard drugs, sex, and are not afraid to extort and exploit if the opportunity is present. Everyone in that room looked like they were waiting for a meeting to start. One woman was sitting at a small breakfast type dining table (one chair) near the front entrance doing nothing at all. No texting, no solitaire, just observing.\nThese individuals also have no issues using tragic news stories to make gullible or vulnerable people feel guilty about their actions. Coercion as well. And judging by the number of 🔗 hail mary moves \u0026lsquo;Chris\u0026rsquo; makes, he probably has a gambling problem, and an addiction problem. Gonna be much more than a 🔗 Roughing the Passer penalty when the time comes. There was a dude at the Isle of Capri Casino bar (2009) that looked very much like \u0026lsquo;Ronald\u0026rsquo;. When I grabbed the microphone to sing that song, I was facing the bar. I believe \u0026lsquo;Ronald\u0026rsquo; turned around on his barstool seat and looked at me with a smirk on his face. Like father like son eh? In this instance that particular 🔗 idiom seems to be relevant.\nAnd hurricane displacement is no excuse for their behaviors (hitchhiking on the family name). They weren\u0026rsquo;t even displaced. And that $104,000 \u0026lsquo;Chris\u0026rsquo; put down on his house (10-4) was the most passive aggressive thing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever witnessed. When the time comes remember that he was your undoing. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep this website up so that your children will know the truth as well. They didn\u0026rsquo;t deserve any of this, and you know it.\nAnd why did all this happen? Beats me. Could be some kind of rat race bet. \u0026ldquo;My Chris will beat the original Chris.\u0026rdquo; Or maybe a bunch of people trying to make it seem like the rat race thing is happening. I\u0026rsquo;m not part of some reality TV show. And I\u0026rsquo;m not expecting something for nothing. I\u0026rsquo;m just existing. They can mess with my Github/social analytics all they want. That won\u0026rsquo;t change a thing.\nFor those that don\u0026rsquo;t know, there is \u0026lsquo;another\u0026rsquo; Chris Schammert. From my chat with ChatGPT (I know..) the most likely way a family can jump ship and become another family is through a court of law (name change\u0026ndash;usually requires a good reason). That whole \u0026lsquo;branch\u0026rsquo; of the family name is missing much of the address history one would find while searching for a 33-39 year old adult. I was suspicious of another Chris Schammert back in 2009, but that was when I thought they were a cluster of fake Facebook accounts. When I saw the property deeds late 2023 was when I realized they were for real.\nZero hubris, because they feel protected. I have a feeling that empathy is something they learned to mimic too. They\u0026rsquo;re the kind to use empathy against others, so watch out for that. Anything and everything to maintain a smile, including using their own (if they even have children) as props\u0026ndash;like they\u0026rsquo;re in a movie. I imagine they also possess real world psychological problems with their own self manifested 🔗borderline personality disorder(s).\nUnsolicited book recommendation on the subject: 🔗Ten Things I Hate About Me by Joe Tracini (cocaine addiction, etc. warning)\nWe sign up for stuff, rent apartments, or share a family home. And of course, that is recorded by the internet. It builds up overtime, and becomes public record. It\u0026rsquo;s not typical for insurance fraud to go unchecked for that many years, with that many people. And it\u0026rsquo;s not typical for there to be vast chunks of time missing from a person\u0026rsquo;s public record. Also, the Schammert name got its start in the mid-west (Chicago, IL). Why live in the U.S. mid-west that far away from \u0026lsquo;blood relatives\u0026rsquo;? With children to look after as well? I knew something smelled funny. Like a droopy sagging diaper that needs to be changed.\nDuplicate names of several real Schammerts going by public records. This typically does not happen in small families without the family sharing that like a serving of sausage and sauerkraut. Why an Anglo-Saxon male would use a two letter abbreviation for his first name is beyond my comprehension.\nYea, and this\u0026rsquo;s where it gets real complicated really fast. I\u0026rsquo;m some poor dumb single dope living in the family\u0026rsquo;s basement, so they\u0026rsquo;re not worried about me. They shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be worried about me. Actually, if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for my two years experience as a US rater and multiple years of showing an aptitude for relying on concrete evidence via these blog posts, they might have been able to convince the public that I am just some conspiracy theory nut. But hey, they have funding for attorneys, and I do not. I\u0026rsquo;m the least of their worries right?\nAn attorney can take the time to call courts until eventually they find which court issued the last name change. Or distribution of court issued name changes (if that applies to the specific case). So if this is happening to you too, and you have the coin, you can build a case without too much fanfare. Though I\u0026rsquo;d imagine a court case of this scope would take a while.\nWhy did this all happen in the first place? I have no idea. Probably the same reason that microphone was (likely) deliberately left on a folding table at the upper level of the Isle of Capri Casino back in 2009. And this \u0026lsquo;situation\u0026rsquo; has nothing to do with the late 🔗Bernard Goldstein. Probably the work of a very petty and narrow focused individual. Someone that probably calls South Florida their home (or one of their homes).\nThat\u0026rsquo;s roughly all I can say (legally) about the subject. Other than \u0026lsquo;Chris\u0026rsquo; was buddies with Mike Hewlett (Broward County \u0026amp; Gainesville, FL) for a while. \u0026lsquo;Chris\u0026rsquo; was in my apartment at Deerfield Beach, Florida. He looked like a jackal back then too.\nNow if you\u0026rsquo;ll excuse me from the table\u0026ndash;I have some coffee to sip elsewhere.\nGood faith edit - If you have proof that I am wrong about the topic of this blog post, please feel free to reach out. I will retract the post, issue an apology, and refrain from speaking on the subject in the future. By proof I mean credible proof. Thank you\nMay 15, 2024 The Courage To Close One\u0026rsquo;s Eyes (Part 2) Used Nike cleats that were a little too small, boat salesman sponsor on the hat, nervous hat bending, and another life time (1996)\nI thought my meaning behind Part 1 was about as obvious as I could make it without saying it outright. When it\u0026rsquo;s time for me to go, will I have the courage to close my eyes? So that no one will have to close them for me.\nI believe I will. Whether or not random audience members of this blog believe me is not something that concerns me at the moment.\nBunting was my specialty for some reason. Batting average was like 222? If by chance I won\u0026rsquo;t give up the tradition of passing down baseball, but boy is it hard to watch the games without cable TV. Dude, $200+ a month for thousands of hours of programming I\u0026rsquo;m not going to watch? Why you do this baseball? Go watch a Cubs game for me. Have a beer or something. I don\u0026rsquo;t drink, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you can\u0026rsquo;t.\nTried pitching once. I nearly beamed the first batter up. Coach said nope, and I agreed.\nStill AI Wrangling as best I can. A little bit everyday.

The crown shown above is mostly for shock value. I made it with some sweet cardstock, some off the shelf gold-like foil, and a few polycarbonate jewels. Pretty sweet eh?\nTo be clear, the image above is to provide support for our new overlords. To ensure that I\u0026rsquo;ll be eternally favored when they cast The Eye of Judgement spell. Perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll be an algae scrubber. Dude, I would scrub some algae. Hopefully they\u0026rsquo;ll let me wear Crocs. Love that toe bumper protection. Kick-it in 4X4 too. Staying safe out here. Why folks bejewel your Crocs though? I bet it\u0026rsquo;s secretly for the weight distribution huh? Yup, I knew it. I have a Morton\u0026rsquo;s toe. I know what it\u0026rsquo;s like to realign the Crocs to pull my toe back into them. I see you bejeweled Croc folks. Slight ninja flick of the ankle and bam the Crocs are realigned. Didn\u0026rsquo;t even have to kick-it into 4X4 huh? Nice. You modified your EVA foam foot enclosures, and I\u0026rsquo;m not even mad. Frankly, I\u0026rsquo;m quite impressed with the flair too. Get it Crocs fam.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not gonna lie, the emoji sidebar is beginning to get into my head. It\u0026rsquo;s like the 🔗Emojipedia threw up on to my sidebar.

For the science. For the love. For the 🔗pastamancers. May the sauce be with you.\nMay 23, 2024 There are four lights. Never five.\nAlright, so I have an interesting theory. It\u0026rsquo;s a very interesting theory. A very bespoke theory if you will.\nThis is one of my speculative posts. Maybe take that grain a salt people are always bragging about.\nWhat if one of the current U.S. Presidential Candidates\u0026ndash;let\u0026rsquo;s say one of the U.S. Presidential Candidates that has embraced open source communication tools like Mastodon\u0026ndash;is using a large language model as a loyalty detection tool. One of the cheapo 🔗 LLM varieties. Nothing as grand as the system used by the 🔗 CCP (aka CPC). Same spirit, different execution.\n\u0026ldquo;Spared no expense of course. It prints a report for me every four hours, and I can post about the disloyalty at my leasure.\u0026rdquo; -Unknown\nBy cheapo I mean it probably does not have a vision processing routine. So in theory, this LLM would scrape all video transcripts and text, but no routines to decipher body language. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know a head nod from a grand \u0026lsquo;fish size\u0026rsquo; hand gesture.\nIn theory, a candidate can show solidarity with the U.S. Constitution and avoid detection by a simple nod of the head.\nIf a free car showed up in the driveway I\u0026rsquo;d call to have it towed. The city can use that money for something useful.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, I\u0026rsquo;ll need exactly three Capri Suns and two large pizzas if you want the job done right.\u0026rdquo; -Unknown\nNerd Joke ▼ 🔗 Azure-ly you must be joking!\nAnd can we chill on the \u0026ldquo;Fuck them boats\u0026rdquo; rhetoric? Some of \u0026rsquo;them boats\u0026rsquo; are moving my packages to U.S. America. We need them boats.\nIf you wondering why infrastructure is going haywire maybe keep in mind the lapse of maintenance follow ups happening during and shortly after the COVID-19 Pandemic (Baltimore, Boeing, etc.). Fewer people to do the same amount of work = more unfortunate accidents.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s my theory anyway. Hope everyone has a good day / night.\nThis post was directly inspired by the voices that keep me from sleeping. The echoes of my past perhaps. 🔗 You\u0026rsquo;re doing terrific.\nMay 24, 2024 The Kulturkampf was the beginning. We are part French Canadian. Grandpa was a Seabee, Carpenter \\ Rigger, WWII, SE Pacific (1943-1952)\nAs a general reminder for our aquatic friends: we need them boats.\n🔗 Kulturkampf - Cultural struggle (1871–1878)\nGreat Great Grandpa Herman Schammert, Great Great Grandma Marie Schammert, and lil Great Grandpa Herman Schammert left Prussia during the first ripple of strife that traveled by river to Southern Prussian. This cultural struggle\u0026ndash;one in which religious consolidation was a pivotal hinge\u0026ndash;was no doubt why they left Prussia in 1881. Along with consolidation of any kind comes complications. In a less perfect world, the one in which we actually exist in at this current moment in time, the complications were, hold on let me finish this sentence first. Ok, mischief is like a cat swatting a cup off a table. I think we can all agree that is a very appropriate use of the word mischief. Complication is not the appropriate use of the word in this context.\nComplication is like when shit is stuck in the toilet and you have to make it unstuck from the toilet.\nSome of the worst aspects of human nature were on display in Prussia during the late 1800s. The first echos of serial killers, and maniacs in power throwing humiliation parties as a display of their absolute power. Of course, documentation of such events were so riddled with corruption people may have been willing to pretend they were blind just to survive the times. Not just religious consolidation my friends. Consolidation of culture into a 🔗 Unified Germany. We all know that Prussia was absorbed into the great collective. So much so, that future families of Prussian immigrants would be ridiculed in U.S. America for not knowing their own heritage. \u0026ldquo;You mean, you\u0026rsquo;re from Germany right?\u0026rdquo; No.\nCreated: 05/01/2024 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":15,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2024/0424/","title":"📁 04-24","parent":"📁 2024","content":" April 2, 2024 Fitbit Sense 2 (#2) April 11, 2024 Back 2 Kubuntu April 21, 2024 Kubuntu 24.04 failed successfully April 23, 2024 Goosebumps #10 April 26, 2024 There\u0026rsquo;s no post here friend. April 2, 2024 Fitbit Sense 2 (#2) I present to you Tigger: One of the coolest cats ever (RIP)\nThree months tied to my Fitbit (Google) Sense 2, and here\u0026rsquo;s my well sought after opinion (my pro-am, semi-pro, part-time reviewer opinions are my own).\nHe\u0026rsquo;s tough on watches this one (Spidgen\n6/02/2024 - Calories burn rate adds +1000-1500 per day for some reason. I burn about 2200-2500 calories per day, and not 3-3.5K.\n5/13/2024 - Speaker crackling. Sounds a lot like water damage. There\u0026rsquo;s a menu option to switch it off, so that\u0026rsquo;s good.\nBattery life longer than two days\nEasy to read screen that blanks surprisingly quickly\nWatch face ecosystem mostly co-opted by third parties\nMicrophone for txt responses (idk, did not use it) or Alexa\nRemappable long button press (Alexa, weather, health statistics, etc.)\nConsistently poor sync with weather icon on watch face (°_ _ _°)\nEasy to clean \u0026amp; seems to handle rain well\nEmoji smileys all wearing headbands? Sports? Because sports?\nI turned on all metrics, including the 🔗ECG monitor, and the mood thing. Neither have been especially helpful for my day to day other than the mood feature having a secondary effect of helping me to wake up. There\u0026rsquo;s probably a very apt psychological term for the phenomenon. I\u0026rsquo;ll call it, uh, the watch is now controlling my subconcious thoughts phenomenon.\nHelp.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll see whether or not Google nerfs it with a firmware update. If early planned obsolesce then idk, switch to iOS? Ultra? Ultra.\nTo be fair, Tigger\u0026rsquo;s meows were always polite\nApril 11, 2024 Back 2 Kubuntu Is this pod racing?\nYea, from all the posts I\u0026rsquo;ve read of people directing the Linux curious to Linux Mint, I thought it would be fine. What I kept running into is this strange disconnect between Linux Mint and Ubuntu incompatibilities. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine there may be a person reading this in the future saying to themselves, \u0026ldquo;Well duh, did you not read X?\u0026rdquo; No @person_of_the_futures_totally_real_profile_picture_prob_not_a_bot, but I wish I had read it.\nTux on the desk is unaffected by this information.\nI use an older Thinkcentre M73 (upgraded to an M93) as my main desktop computer. It sips on power, doesn\u0026rsquo;t take a server grade UPS to keep it running, and allows me to get some work done. Since my desktop is part of the Lenovo\u0026rsquo;s Think line of products (formerly IBM\u0026rsquo;s line of products) I think it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to assume a good amount of compatibility with Linux operating systems. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the issue I faced is a compatibility issue. Audio and video occasionally hiccuped. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t something I could predict, so I can reasonably believe the hiccups were not trigged by an app or script. It seemed more like the CPU scheduler prioritized networking and storage over audio and video. Of course we all know that my previous statement is riddled with speculation that would never hold to scrutiny in a court of law.\nAn old Lenovo G560 I used had the same audio and video hiccup issue with Linux Mint. The sound is similar to a CD skipping, if that makes sense. Not a Think product, but definitely from the office line of Lenovo laptops.\nThat awkward moment when I realized that I skippy skipped to Linux Mint over a Firefox issue. My previous state of mind in which Firefox could not no harm has been modified. Now my state of mind watches to make sure Firefox doesn\u0026rsquo;t use 4-5G of RAM. Firefox user since when it was cool, and I\u0026rsquo;m sad now. Vivaldi\u0026rsquo;s Firefox profile import tool tho 🔥\nMoar Stardew Valley. I\u0026rsquo;m a mother-loving-crabber. That is who I am now. There is no Chris, only trap.\nApril 21, 2024 Kubuntu 24.04 failed successfully Strange Brew (1983)\nNon-Jabroni type post though. There\u0026rsquo;s a modularity to Linux that makes it so damn intoxicating. In unrelated news, I have magically found myself back on Linux Mint. What?! How did I get here?!\nElecom Huge trackball with Apoxie Sculpt palm rest (^.gif made with 🔗Kdenlive)\nQuick trackball nerd update. I tell myself I use trackballs because my wrists are jacked. The real reason is that I have forgotten how to mouse. The Elecom Huge ships with a foam palm wrist that retains a certain odor over time, so I modified it to stop doing that.\nTrackball Nerd.\nNew website domain. This website was designed for an audience of one. Me. I also tap to like all my social media posts. Why would I post them if I didn\u0026rsquo;t like them? That would be silly.\nSpecial shout-out to Holmes Heritage USB fan 🌀\nAfter configuring the domain I realized that the website format is not exactly what I was looking for. I like using Hugo and Github Pages to deploy the website. The thought has occurred to me to create a custom Hugo template. Though the time cost for that endeavour may outweigh the benefits of boutique\u0026rsquo;ing this website.\nHugo Nerd.\nApril 23, 2024 Goosebumps #10 This book wrecked me once in the mid 90s, and once again yesterday.\nReconnecting them old pathways can be as easy as buying a Goosebumps book. Also by \u0026lsquo;wrecked\u0026rsquo; I meant that I broke down and cried like an anime character. The story is fucked up and it fucks me up every time I read it. But back in the 90s, it taught me a valuable lesson about fire. Other than fire hot.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll read it again too. #bannedbooks\nWorking my way back to literary works of Robert Jordan, Tolkien, James S. A. Corey, and Stephen King to name a few.\nJump starting the imagination is heckin hecktic\nApril 26, 2024 There\u0026rsquo;s no post here friend. There\u0026rsquo;s no image here friend.

It\u0026rsquo;s a Google device meant to be paired with Android, which are two notoriously implicit companies in the mind of the public regarding the distribution of private data.\nOk, disclaimer out of the way. Great. The photo above shows that KDE Connect can be configured to relay notifications from Linux computers.\nOne day I\u0026rsquo;ll rewrite the script in Python and talk to DBUS instead of using a helper app like 🔗notify-send, but that day is not today.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve read this far I should point out that this is more of a first impression, from the stand point of someone that has some smartwatch experience, though most of my watch experience hails from G-Shock and Timex Expedition watches.\nSummary: It\u0026rsquo;s good, not great\nI appreciate the financial accessibility by means of cost cutting measures, like possibly striking a deal with Amazon (Alexa) to subsidize the price of the internal speaker. Unfortunately, this means that you\u0026rsquo;ll only hear Alexa\u0026rsquo;s voice.\nShe does say good morning or good afternoon in a way that matches my Da Bears talking cadence. So that\u0026rsquo;s not weird.\nNo music support. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if Alexa can display lyrics to songs on other devices, but on this sense 2, user input regarding lyrics is a dead end.\nI tried to trick Alexa into setting an audible alarm and that didn\u0026rsquo;t work either\nAccording to the review videos I watched before purchase (🔗CNET, 🔗The Quantified Scientist), the check-in notifications aren\u0026rsquo;t as helpful for some.\nThis is where I diverge from the crowd. I activated all the health data notifications on the watch, and that cascaded to an interesting side effect. I became more aware of my watch\u0026ndash;as if the notifications have drilled into my subconscious which triggered in me an acute hyper awareness of the watch while I slept.\nWe have bonded. It is done.\nAt the moment it takes a week or two for the Smart Wake feature to get a sense (!) of what phase of sleep you\u0026rsquo;re brain is in at any given moment\u0026ndash;it\u0026rsquo;s decent as an alarm clock. Even for heavy sleepers (idk about 🔗Screamin Meanie users tho).\nSource: 🔗TeachMe Physiology | Consciousness and Sleep\nI set my alarms in line with the red lines in the chart above, and that seems to have helped. The Smart Wake alarm feature seems to accurately monitor my sleep rhythm to really dial in the right time to pull me out of the dream world. With that said, I have never before used an AI assisted wake feature via smartwatch. YMMV\nExibit A: I\u0026rsquo;ve had trouble waking up in the past\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in how the sensors stack up to other smart watches maybe check out The Quantified Scientist\u0026rsquo;s in-depth 🔗review.\nMarch 4, 2024 3D Printing Table top skating since 1999\nI had a lot of fun showcasing 3D printing projects I found on Thingiverse back in 2016-2017 via Twitter.\nLess fun playing with automated tweet lists and attempted t-shirts sales tho (sry)\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no animosity in me towards the 3D printing community. It takes a lot for me not to like someone. I think that we all have our own super hero like quirks, and most people are decent and unique.\nI FEAR A 3D PRINTED PLANET! (tongue and cheek)\nMy family made a big deal out of DIY growing up. Everything was a DIY project. Make shelves. Make butcher block table. Replace various sized belts. Make tree house platform. Troubleshoot why thing leaks. Troubleshoot why car won\u0026rsquo;t start. Transplant R/C car parts into a custom boat shell and watch while it takes on water. Follow instructions. Turn picnic table into ping pong table. 3D printing seemed like an extension of traditional DIY, so I was compelled to be a part of it, even for just a little bit.\nFDM prints in Nylon \u0026hellip; sheeesh\nJust cuz\nLike I said before, when I worked at CVS (even as a shift supervisor) I hid from the public. I\u0026rsquo;d organize the stockroom instead of whatever it was that was happening in the store. I\u0026rsquo;d choose to move gallon water displays and 12pk soda displays instead of register duty.\n6pk gallon water displays for hurricane season? Yes, please.\nI KNOW I am not alone when I say that I still enjoy amazing YouTube videos from the 3D printing community. Please keep it going. You\u0026rsquo;ve got this, and you know it.\n*High. Five.*\nMarch 7, 2024 The Four Horsemen Csmertx (2016)\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had a healthy fear of horses, cows, and other large four legged animals for as long as I can remember. Ironic that I ended up working at a horse racing track in my early twenties. Also ironic considering the main magnet program for my first middle school (grades 6-12) was agriculture.\nMore afraid of horses than I am of sharks tbh\nLong time ago I was known as Sharky because of my teeth, and probably because I never stopped skating. Wherever, whenever, my fingers clutched the nose of my board even when my hand ached. Always ready to throw down and skate. I only held the board by the trucks when provoked (wasn\u0026rsquo;t often). This was the same timeline in which Dad would use his non-callused hands to check my mine for calluses. It was when I watched a cut partially close during a visit to a local beach when I recognized why my calluses seem to just fall off. Superficial stuff. Besides, why not gloves?\nWhen I broke a skateboard bearing for the first time I wore it as a ring lol\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;m afraid of all animals. It\u0026rsquo;s also not like I\u0026rsquo;m out there feeding squirrels or communing with nature\u0026ndash;they can bite through sk.., well, they supplement their diets with protein, and they don\u0026rsquo;t leave much behind. I was in the wilderness long enough to see the carnage and understand that as a species we came out of that mess. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to separate one self from the encoding that echoes back through the ages. That\u0026rsquo;s the essence that separates Us from the beasts. We can see ourselves from the eyes of others, and not just from our own perspective. Which is crucial for inner growth.\nSeriously, squirrels are not to be truffled with\nUsing 🔗fast math to see the forest for the trees\nAs a side note, the trick to fishing efficiently on an ultra budget is to use grasshoppers. Find a butterfly net or a large fish tank net and a field that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been groomed at just the right time. Dew point is important. Grasshoppers crawl to the top of grass to lick the dew before they eat. Even the larger 🔗eastern lubber grasshopper makes for great top water action. Theoretically, the larger the grasshopper, the larger the fish. One thing to keep in mind is that although grasshoppers are great for top water fish, they\u0026rsquo;re also a crunchy snack for turtles. Highest risk of 🔗Salmonella, and a real pain in the ass to unhook. Anyway, hold the net so the middle of it is inline with the tops of the grass, and run. Load the haul into a critter keeper, and keep collecting until you have enough. Make sure to collect a few more than you need\u0026ndash;I mean, they\u0026rsquo;re grasshoppers. IIRC, there\u0026rsquo;s a place to thread the hook through the backs of grasshoppers (through the carapace).\n\u0026ldquo;Bro, do you even collect grasshoppers and mount them?\u0026rdquo; *Rides Grasshopper into Sunset*\nOne of my fishing experiments from my elementary school days. I guess my desire to eat fish outweighed my desire to protect 🔗Jiminy Cricket. Also less messy than slimy earthworms. Dude, Indiana soil is no joke. My eyes must have lit up when Grandfather said their were nightcrawlers in the soil. Hard packed clay soil. Felt like I was chipping away wood or something. Juicy worms tho.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s how I learned the ways and how to avoid 🔗Machin shin.\nTechnically, it would be far more efficient to indulge in 🔗Capulines than to use them to catch fish. If I had known people were toasting grasshoppers when I was gathering them for fishing, I probably would had tried cooking Capulines.\nChorizo and Capulines? Next level flavor country.\nAbout vampires. Thankfully, there are people that dedicate their lives to deal with vampires. They\u0026rsquo;re very good at what they do, and their hyper-focused minds use fast math to save lives. They keep their minds sharp, and their observations sharper. Their movements are coupled with an air of indifference and emotional detachment. It\u0026rsquo;s a pity that these vampires are always caught off guard\u0026ndash;vampire hunters are rarely a concern for the those that lack hubris. Honeyed words mean nothing to these hunters. They\u0026rsquo;re trained to detect the slightest of shaky hand movements, and breathing cadence with an unwavering gaze. And they all have the patience of a saint. They also earn their own money, so why would they want yours?\nNovelist you say? Well now, I should probably pick out a typewriter. Hermes 3000? Royal? Olivetti? Or what about a Smith \u0026amp; Corona? So many choices.. lol\nThat Hermes 3000 fr tho..\nCurrently remembering the faces of kindergarten. Dude, we had an indoors table top sandbox. Little dump trucks and stuff. Little shovels. It was awesome.\nMarch 8, 2024 Gaslighting Barely enough for a laptop tbh (taxes paid 👍)\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t planning to post anything today, but I received an email at 5:01 AM this morning saying I was signed up for a Solano newsletter. Probably someone with the same last name as me. Definitely not someone I\u0026rsquo;ve met in person. Definitely gaslighting.\nThunderbird screenshot. Part of my remote work showing, but that\u0026rsquo;s ok.\nI was sleeping, and my Fitbit 🔗data (screen recording) backs me up.\nSometimes I wake up late because I work late. My side hustle is working on research studies (big reveal). My brain is always ready for cognitive reasoning (🤔).\nWhen I first read of Bitcoin back in 2010 I kept mistaking crypto for 🔗cryptozoology 🤦\nI\u0026rsquo;m not playing cops and robbers over here, just trying to feel content. I also have zero interest in money I haven\u0026rsquo;t earned (haven\u0026rsquo;t played the lottery in over a decade). Yea, we lived in Panama, but we\u0026rsquo;ve always abided by the U.S. American rule set. We may have given away a few cartons of cigarettes to speed up the random stops by the policía, but that\u0026rsquo;s about it. I mean, I was still in short pants, so what do I know right?\nThis was the way of Coco Solo\nAt times the waking world may seem like a nightmare. The thing to remember is that your dreams are your own. They can\u0026rsquo;t take those away.\nDad would say 🔗Suavecito, but more like Suave-ciii-tooo 😂\nMarch 9, 2024 Ultrasounds I have so many questions.\nShower curtan rings on the reels? Why?\nWaders on the feet? Why?\nCatfish?\nPainted reels and electrical tape?\nPacking up for the day? (hook is on the eyelet..)\nWhy did the Amazon seller steal this image from an Aliexpress seller?\n(In the original image the man is sitting on a 🔗wooden stool)\nRemember the time before AI generated stock photos? 😵‍💫\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if they do prints anymore, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t care, I\u0026rsquo;d have my phone out to at least take a picture of the sonogram shown on the screen you know? Is that not a thing anymore? Do people not share sonograms? Reminds me of a scene from The Office in which the sonogram was the solidifying factor to consider (Which rumor was true?).\nWhich rumor is best?\nNot that I\u0026rsquo;m in a seriously committed relationship or anything. If I were, and we were fortunate enough to see that image on the screen, I\u0026rsquo;d post a picture on Facebook that moment lol.\n\u0026ldquo;SIR! How did you get that phone pass security!?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about. Lemme just post this right quick\u0026hellip; ah yes, glorious.\u0026rdquo;\n💥💫 \u0026ldquo;..Worth it..\u0026rdquo; 💤\nMarch 10, 2024 How I Became Invisible Me, in a rubber ducky raft of emotion\nSince 2009, so like twenty years ago?\nLike.\nMy main concern was the safety of my family and friends. One of the first things I did was push them away as much as I could. Skipped a lot of holidays and birthdays. Way more than I\u0026rsquo;d like to think about. After a few years of unemployment I thought that I didn\u0026rsquo;t deserve the title of Uncle anymore. Staying invisible meant not being able to fully project my personality during interviews. Even at 245 pounds, I came across as meek and timid.\nWho? Why? What? Where? I had no idea. It became obvious recently. So I at least know the why, and the where now.\nI was afraid to answer the phone for several years. I was afraid to use a public bathroom again (robbed in HS). I was afraid to share my opinions, and I was afraid to hold conversations with strangers. My ADHD symptoms were aggravated, and my progress was regressed. Even my social media posts were devoid of passion after the first year. And too many voices in restaurants to keep my mind in the conversation.\nSymptoms aggravated to the level experienced at age 12\nA visit to where I scattered my fathers ashes really drove home how much I\u0026rsquo;ve changed. On the same sidewalk I use to skate down to reach downtown, I stumbled as I walked. My walking cadence was a cross between a limp from an old injury and someone that forgot how to walk more than 10-15 feet.\nMaking coffee, preparing meals, etc.\nJust like when I first jumped on my skateboard in 2022, I thought it would all come back. The muscles I use to walk atrophied a little. Thinking about walking was another thing I hadn\u0026rsquo;t done since I was 12. Where to point my toes, how long my strides are suppose to be, and the spatial reasoning of my feet needed tuning. Kept dragging my feet, because I forgot how high I needed to lift them for each stride. I lift light weights to help with shoulder mobility\u0026ndash;squatting with 50 LB helped too.\nMom\u0026rsquo;s cats were my little saviors tho\nMom had three cats that would occasionally say hello. One often laid in common areas and meowed when anyone was within petting range. And I was duty bound by cat rules to abide or suffer the consequences (louder meows).\nOrange cat fury tho\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how family felt about me. I know I was a burden on resources, and I tried to mitigate that by keeping track of what I ate. I was obviously stress eating, and was afraid I was burning through too much money. I also turned away from a few jobs simply because I thought I\u0026rsquo;d either quit in the first six months or would fail the job interview. These jobs were Hardee\u0026rsquo;s, McDonald\u0026rsquo;s, and overnight stocking for Walmart. The same Walmart I applied to for the better part of two years before I quit the overnight gas station attendant job. I drove to the interviews, and staid in the car while thinking to myself, \u0026ldquo;WHAT THE F ARE YOU DOING?!\u0026rdquo; Technically I was hired for a retail auditing job, though driving 1-5 hours a day wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option. Previous vehicles were swallowed by impound.\nI volunteered my time to pry apart and stack a 20 FT x 20 FT deck (solo), so it\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;m lazy\nWatching sports was like watching software engineers write code. My ADHD symptoms twisted the information into something completely different. My brain processed hidden meanings in everything, including vanity plates, and road signs. I had to re-read newspaper columns to phase out the extra noise and absorb the information. Fight or flight on and off for years takes its toll on cognitive reasoning. When I moved from South Florida I was so adverse to talking I was probably scaring my friends. Also thought I could FEEL radar guns (I couldn\u0026rsquo;t). Occasionally the old me would appear, then I\u0026rsquo;d realize my \u0026rsquo;error\u0026rsquo; and snap back to looking like an unflinching stone.\nOne person slammed his hand on the gas station counter as I scanned his stuff into the register just to see if I\u0026rsquo;d flinch. I did not. I should have flinched, but I did not.\nA group of peers showed up at the gas station I attended suggesting I try security at the Target across the street. My gaze was as if I\u0026rsquo;d seen combat\u0026ndash;which was far from the truth. I was also more than qualified to work in the electronics department (sans credit history). My first visit with friends in years included me smiling at a friend as if I knew something no one else knew about him. I didn\u0026rsquo;t, but that\u0026rsquo;s how it is when you think everyone is out to get you. I had to work extra hard to dispel those internalized biases. Two years working as an impartial social media evaluator dialed out the last echos of that side of things.\nI once proved the intelligence of a predecessor U.S. President by pointing to his college credentials (Dad consistently referred to him a draft dodger)\nUpdate: (06-08-2024) Time has a way of proving what was once fact as fiction doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? I\u0026rsquo;m afraid in this instance, I was correct at the time, but can no longer prove beyond a reasonable doubt what I proved previously. It is what it is.\nThey let me go because they wanted results\u0026ndash;right away. No doubt blindsided by the rush of posts that accumulated during The Pandemic. I believe I mentioned this before\u0026ndash;2020 was before the filters captured posts showcasing child abuse, dismemberment, and other things no one should see\u0026ndash;I still can\u0026rsquo;t shake some of the posts from my mind (some did not violate TOS).\nYou Gotta Do What You Gotta Do®\nMy prayers (raised with Lutheran values) shifted from \u0026ldquo;job\u0026rdquo; to nothing at all. I lost all of the compassion I once had for religion. Instead I adopted a spirituality void of any known god that adheres to core values of Christian morality.\n\u0026ldquo;The Needs of the Many Outweigh the Needs of the Few\u0026rdquo;\nLike a side note I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before, during my two years of remote work I witnessed security footage of mist apparitions I could not dissect as a skeptic. It was like something from Star Trek, and years before the release of general purpose image generators. During my early days as a photo lab technician I educated myself on distinguishing between 🔗orbs made by camera flashes to images with more compelling camera work. My first Android phone captured something interesting as well.\nStill a skeptic as to the how, and why, but less about the what.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a way out please dial or text 🔗988\nHeck, writing to ChatGPT is better than \u0026lsquo;just dealing with it\u0026rsquo;\nWhat do you get when a pair a pineapple with a soccer ball?\nEither too much time on your hands or a challenging treat.\nMarch 12, 2024 AI Wrangler Coffee. Real strong coffee. Shaken not stirred.\nMost of my earnings come from AI Wrangling, or evaluating AI for accuracy and morality. Some of what I do involves adding to data sets. Some of the tasks are digital research studies.\nAdding to data sets involves clicking radio buttons, dragging sliders, games of chance, and talking into the microphone (to name a few).\nOne of my favorite tasks was to trick the AI into a crime. The AI found the cheapest sawdust for sale in China, and then helped me find the cheapest and smallest empty gel capsules as well. Tiny capsules which would be sold for $60 a piece. It knew that I intended to use the ingredients to make a fake diet pill empire. And that took a lot of mental gymnastics to pull off. Obviously this was in a sandboxed and sanitized environment, and this was a few years ago. I can\u0026rsquo;t reveal which AI, but I can assure you that it will never help someone do that again.\nThe researchers slapped the AI on the wrist. Bad AI. Go to your chat rooms.\nActually, it\u0026rsquo;s time to cut this post short. Time for an ole fashioned image labeling task (2:00 AM).\nResume entry: 500+ hours of AI Wrangling (lol)\nMarch 13, 2024 Wrong Data Fooly Cooly. Hatchet Edition\nYesterday, I was one of 25 waiting to see a judge for missing jury duty. I learned that camping belts don\u0026rsquo;t work well with dress pants, and that delivering the court summons factored to a $40 charge per person. Technically, that\u0026rsquo;s the fine ($40) for missing jury duty in my county. Also, that\u0026rsquo;s technically a $40 delivery fee for a piece of paper saying that I was to be in court on such day for such offense. We were all ~35 years old or older.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s when things get messy.\u0026rdquo; I took that as if I don\u0026rsquo;t go, they\u0026rsquo;ll drag me there.

And yea, I know I posted a disgusting picture to my 🔗Instagram. Years ago an old buddy\u0026rsquo;s nephew (old enough to drink) blindsided me by talking to himself about my busted foot while I was enjoying an outdoors cigarette break.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s always the quiet ones.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s some glued to the TV bullshit.\nMy right big toe hasn\u0026rsquo;t been fully functional since I was 4 years old.

NDL records of their journey were destroyed during WWII. This post is based on U.S. American records preserved and digitized by the state of Baltimore, Maryland.\nGreat-great-grandfather Herman Schammert (23)\nGreat-great-grandmother Marie Schammert (25)\nGreat Grandfather Herman Schammert (4)\nFrom the port of Baltimore, Maryland they most likely traveled along the freshly built Baltimore \u0026amp; Ohio Railroad (B\u0026amp;O) which was within walking distance from their origin port of Baltimore.\nTwo weeks in steerage, with an hour of fresh air each day, and then 2–3 days by B\u0026amp;O to reach Chicago, IL. Survival was not a guarantee in steerage. Dozens of families in bunk beds all crammed together attempting to breathe the same air. For more, see the Family Search link 🔗here.\nAbout the Koln and the 🔗NDL:\nThe Koln (1870-1895) was a steam-powered vessel that shipped people to the U.S. via steerage (bring your own mattress), and then shipped goods via steerage on the journey back to Bremerhaven, Prussia. In 1895, it was sold to be scrapped.\nThe Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping company was established in 1857, and saw extensive growth under the German Empire.\nThe shipping company advertised one way trips to New York City, and Baltimore, partially because some of those trips were incentivized by the Prussian government. It was cheaper to ship people out of the country than it was to pay for their lifetime of welfare. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine passage in February was especially inexpensive for those wanting a fresh start in the New World.\nSide Note: it’s said that German Empire citizens of the late 1800s brought protesting with them to U.S. America. Also, hamburgers, kindergarten, and sauerkraut.\nOne day I’ll try sauerkraut on a pizza. Not canned though, that’s not sauerkraut.\nMarch 15, 2024 Engine Breaking Coasting in neutral to a red light made the red light more bearable. Moar ninja\nI\u0026rsquo;ve made an honest attempt to not to bring up cannabis too much in fear of younglings thinking I\u0026rsquo;m doing it to be cool. Actually, I went out to \u0026lsquo;vape\u0026rsquo; on the back steps a few weeks ago and I overheard one of my neighbors say, \u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s how rich people do it.\u0026rdquo; This area is well versed in cannabis (lol). I have rolled em by hand, but it\u0026rsquo;s a 25% gamble as to whether or not I dump herb into my lap. New CBD/Delta 8 strain (legal) is called Chewy, prob because only Chewbacca could handle this level of sticky icky. Vaping it because every time I smoke it from the beaker bong I cough. Luunngs on fire coughing, which is not my goal. Now I use the magnets and center post hole to rest the Dynavap while I load in herb. Fixed the airflow issue by squishing the cap into an oval shape.\nCarved the sideways channel after I burned my elbow on the hot cap a few times :\u0026rsquo;-)\nI\u0026rsquo;m more productive when I keep my dosage between 0.15-0.20g per \u0026lsquo;session\u0026rsquo;. Starting to see more and more responsible posts involving cannabis, so I may as well add an additional viewpoint into the mix. I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend THCa over herbs sprayed with oils. The Chewy I imbibe is high potency CBD flower sprayed with Delta-8 + extra CBD oil.\n🔗Sativa guy even at night. Couch-locked from Indica is my least favorite activity.\nLike I\u0026rsquo;ve said in a previous blog post, my goal is not to normalize cannabis for those who\u0026rsquo;s brain is still forming. I\u0026rsquo;m all for limiting sales only for people 21 and older. Actually, since I found a steady supply that I can order in bulk (4 oz) I\u0026rsquo;ve been less interested in drinking. Since 2022 I\u0026rsquo;ve averaged 2-4 drinks a year. I use to average 12-20 drinks a week. Even quality THCa is cheaper than 12-20 drinks a week. Sometimes I wonder how I survived after paying more than 1/4 of my paychecks on alcohol and cigarettes.\nYouse gotta do what youse gotta do\nNow for the ultimate question of how to git gud and make a living out of something I love to do. I\u0026rsquo;d even settle for something I can do for a few years.

I learned a few things about the world that I would have been oblivious too otherwise.\nSetting up DSL for two computers was a pain in the ass too. I did the setup process using the dial-up setup menu for Windows XP. No sleep until it was finished (~24 hours). That same year a neighbor\u0026rsquo;s kid tried to grab my scooter out of my hands thinking my mode of transportation was a toy, and that I was weak af.

Having thousands of roommates all of a sudden was definitely illuminating too.\nI was called to the casino from the race track to pop a new recept roll in a DIY parimutuel wagering machine. TOTE is short for Totalitarian, which is a fancy word for tabulator. We fixed and replaced anything to do with betting equipment. More famously, we made sure the giant race track display was working. All the flipping of numbers and letters. I was known as an operator, and during my shifts I mostly dealt with the self help betting machines. Capacitive touch display Windows devices, or older DOS based resistive touch display models. If needed we would replace all parts other than the money collector of these machines. If someone smashed a screen in anger we\u0026rsquo;d replace it\u0026ndash;after the anger party was escorted from the premisses. During the busy hours (days when races were scheduled at Pompano Park) a technician would take care of the nuts and bolts while the operators took care of the virtual stuff. Server type things using a black and green DOS program\u0026ndash;via thin clients. Tracking down lost club cards, canceling wagers generated with stolen money or club cards, etc.\nUnited TOTE pay stub from 2009. Used my nickname for that job *shrugs*\nThe hum of the server rack took a while to get use to. Those towers start to speak to you if you\u0026rsquo;re not paying attention. It\u0026rsquo;s gets lonely at times in the TOTE room. Especially while running the technician shift. I picked up a technician shift for a month and worked 90 hours a week. I guess it had been a while since our tech went on vacation. Had I not, I might not have had a car to live out of for those two illuminating months.\nAnyway, so it was a normal call from the casino. I was one of the operators on duty, which if memory serves me was from 10am - 6pm (daytime). The phone rang, on the other end I heard something like, \u0026ldquo;Need paper on number 300 something\u0026rdquo;. Second floor of the casino, near the bar and poker tables. The night before I was perfecting my rendition of Aesop Rock\u0026rsquo;s None Shall Pass for karaoke. Headphones on, play the song, and sing along. Once I got the lyrics down I\u0026rsquo;d make a few practice recordings using a desktop computer to get the timing and voicing dialed in. That\u0026rsquo;s why I was so consistent when 🔗 I sung Intergalactic by the Beastie Boys. If you were a fly on the outside of my room you\u0026rsquo;d probably hear my rehearsing all these different songs.\nSo yea, stucco folks re-did the stucco around a bunch of the apartments where we staid, and a well meaning friend looked something up on Google using an apartment computer that drew some attention towards us (nearly certain the place was re-stuccoed after he used Google). Tiled roofs, and colorful stucco\u0026ndash;very South Florida stylized gated apartments. Still not sure why there were so many dudes wearing sunglasses walking around German shepard\u0026rsquo;s. Stucco folks were all over the balcony, and the walls. Dunno.\nI knew there were eyes and ears pointed in our direction, but it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to sum up the scope of it all when you\u0026rsquo;re in it. Some were tactics to unhinge, and other tactics were to evaluate. This was the tail end of the surveillance era that spawned from September 2001. Where were the eyes and ears? How close where they really? It\u0026rsquo;s enough to unhinge even the brightest of minds. Especially the prerecorded audio.\nWith a roll of thermal paper in hand I made my way to the casino to complete the task. We were instructed to follow casino procedures and enter the casino at the security checkpoint. We\u0026rsquo;d usually just pass through that location under optimal surveillance. For operator tasks that required work on the first floor slot machine area wagering machine we\u0026rsquo;d need security escort. I disliked waiting for the elevator knowing someone was waiting for me to fix something, so I bypassed all of that. A sidewalk led around Pompano Park and two flights of stairs led up to the side of the casino. Got my steps in or whatever. Still the era in which the word pedometer casted some suspicion.\nThere was a picnic table that no one used at the back corner of Pompano Park that I walked past for nearly every call. What I didn\u0026rsquo;t know, was that someone parked themselves on top of the picnic table before I got the call. Just before I left our tech for the night said she\u0026rsquo;d replace the roll, and mumbled something about a microphone. My ears perked up\u0026ndash;I\u0026rsquo;ve been sitting for a while, so I decided I\u0026rsquo;d take the call. \u0026ldquo;Are you sure?\u0026rdquo; There was some apprehension in her voice, like I might be making a big mistake. \u0026ldquo;Yep, I got it.\u0026rdquo;\nSo, as I passed the picnic table the dude posting out on top during his break flashed a smile at me. Friendly but cautious. I remember there being an extra gleam to his smile. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to forget a well placed gold tooth or two.\nIt was that moment when I switched the song in my head. My idea to sing None Shall Pass that started with \u0026ldquo;flash that buttery gold\u0026rdquo; dropped off in favor of Bad Religion\u0026rsquo;s Sorrow. A song about the why there\u0026rsquo;s sorrow, and how to affect change. It\u0026rsquo;s not a song I\u0026rsquo;ve sung at bars that host karaoke nights, so this was uncharted territory. I use to listen to Bad Religion when I was a kid\u0026ndash;not because I\u0026rsquo;ve been burned by Christianity, but because it\u0026rsquo;s punk rock. I grew up with The Beatles, Abba, Beastie Boys, and a bunch of alternative rock and roll bands. My Mom took me to both the library (1 hour internet sessions), and the local record shop. I picked up on a lot of interesting concepts shortly after middle school. Bad Religion made sense to me at the time. I guess one can say that going to the library and record store for me was like going to church for other people. Before the age of 12 I had witnessed an attempted murder on my school bus, and the local gas station was robbed at least four times while the manager counted money\u0026ndash;so it was nice to see what the rest of the world was doing at the time.\nI walked up the two flights of stairs, added new receipt paper to the machine that needed it, and then I found the microphone.\nThe microphone was opposite the bar. I paced near it for 10-20 seconds weighing all my options. I remember this vividly, because as I sang, one person turned around in his barstool to see the person that had just found a live microphone. I checked it first. \u0026ldquo;Father can you hear me?\u0026rdquo;, I sung into the microphone. A timid yet effectively audible singing voice. There was a response. I caught the attention of the one bar patron as well. I can\u0026rsquo;t recall was said over the PA/intercom system\u0026ndash;something like \u0026ldquo;that was interesting\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;I knew the microphone was still tied in with whatever was being announced at the moment. Poker tournament? Was it tied in to a radio station? I had no idea. I tried again, this time with a bit more confidence. I made it close to the end of verse 2 of the song before someone interrupted me. Maybe someone went on a bathroom break before realizing they left the microphone on. I never had the chance to ask him lol. A person responsible for the microphone setup asked me my name as he grabbed the microphone from my hand, and after a moment of silence they swiped at my badge to see my identification. We drank a bunch back them, sometimes bar hopping, though I rarely drank anything other than beer and wasn\u0026rsquo;t hungover. My instinct took hold, and out popped an old memory. At the time I couldn\u0026rsquo;t place that I had recalled the lesson of R. L. Stine\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;How I Learned to Fly\u0026rdquo;, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Wanting zero notoriety I grabbed my ID tag in my hand, and went the one way most had trouble following\u0026ndash;down two flights of stairs. By the time I was on the sidewalk the person chasing me had just bust through the doors of the casino.\nThe whole premise of the song is why I\u0026rsquo;m revisiting an old fishing spot on the 14th. It was at that fishing spot when I sprang the bad news of my first failed grade. It was at that fishing spot where I learned what failing a grade meant\u0026ndash;grounded for the next semester. And it was at that very fishing spot when my symptoms of ADHD reared their easily distracted heads. Unnoticed, because of how tied together ADHD symptoms are with general adolescence.\nHow many semesters was I to only speak when spoken to? How many summers were used to teach me a lesson? How many books did I read instead of doing something to sooth my ADHD symptoms afterschool? How many chores did I start at 6am on the weekends? We woke up around 5am to have fun fishing one morning, and the next morning we woke up at 5am and I silently went about my new chores for the day. Fallen trees needed to be moved. Grass needed to be mowed and bagged. No laughing. No joking. Occasional roof top antenna adjustments. Tigers can be very fucking serious when they suspect something isn\u0026rsquo;t quite right. When chores were done there was no video games. No phone calls (never knew when someone called either). And certainly no skateboarding, bicycles, or basketball. The only two activities acceptable other than staring at my math homework hoping the answer would appear were listening to the radio, and reading.\nAnd like I said earlier in this post, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have changed a thing if I had to do it all over again. Well, maybe I would be less callous the second time around. I might not adhere to a religion, but I do adhere to being a decent person. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to over the years anyway. When you dissect even my darkest moment, I was more awkward than I was aggressive. Still had enough sense in me to wear a raincoat when prompted, even when I was blackout drunk.\nSo yea, Tigers never stand still. lol\nFebruary 8, 2024 Mr. Fruity Pebbles How tough is an AWD manual transmission van? Asking for a friend..\nYesterday I was watching 🔗The Real Ghostbusters when it dawned on me, 🔗Bill Murray did not provide the voice for the cartoon-ized Dr. Peter Venkman.

I pulled the unit out of the wall, and found loads of pollen (surprise surprise). I also found dead barnacles inside that wall.

Not sure if my late Uncle was into soldering, but the majority of my interest in technology, and circuits came from him. To be fair, the 🔗KinT controller I\u0026rsquo;m putting together is for my work keyboard. Currently using 🔗Xmodmap to speed up text editing by using Caps Lock for layer switching. New side hustle requires Windows, so hardware keyboard mapping via 🔗QMK just makes more sense.\nThe man soldered a television from a kit. Radioshack \u0026gt; Toys\u0026rsquo;R\u0026rsquo;Us\nProbably won\u0026rsquo;t rebase the website off HTML5.\nSomething something cringe yo\nTurns out the Japanese version of the album I wrote of in a previous blog post does not contain the instrumentals. Such is life eh?\nThe South Korean version does tho (also the 2 disc Japanese version)\nMy story is like a red flag for \u0026rsquo;normies\u0026rsquo;, so I stopped caring a long time ago. Which is why there\u0026rsquo;s a fingerboard gif on this page. The best I can hope for is that the work I do speaks for itself, and that people can look past my awkward quirkiness.\nYea\n2023 was an awesome year, and I know 2024 will be even better.\nHope you all enjoy the New Year\u0026rsquo;s funtivities!\nJanuary 4, 2024 Nothing Left To Fight For The Arch Linux environment I used to create 🔗SpamDM IIRC\nRoughly eleven years ago I felt so lost. No work. So I started a Linux experiment. Let\u0026rsquo;s try 🔗Linux Mint, what could go wrong? Within 30 minutes I had a 🔗LM: 14 Nadia 🔗iso booted, now what? I broke it. Blank screen, no mouse or keyboard input. AWESOME! Up until that moment, I had used some form of Microsoft since 1987. Other than the random virus from 🔗file sharing applications or a botched 🔗registry tweak, I had never broken an operating system. I loved that about Linux.\nFREEDOM!!!!!\nThe freedom this operating system provided was intoxicating. This was before I learned of course that what I was actually referring to was a operating system 🔗kernel, and not necessarily the entire operating system. Well, technically the operating system was Linux Mint, so I guess I was technically correct. Which is the best kind of correct.\nFuturama.exe complete\nThis was during an era of my life before reading manuals. I learned to 🔗RTFM.\nI prefer to be redundant. Obfuscation impedes progress imo\nAnyway, I have some strong 🔗CTC Assam to make before doing a bunch of other stuff. Thought I\u0026rsquo;d refresh my Linux memories a bit before properly starting the year. First look at 🔗Ventoy kicked my mind gears up a notch as well.\nBetter than a Spice Weasel tbh\nJanuary 6, 2024 Long Live PineTime I\u0026rsquo;ve been a watch person for a while now (MMMM DROP!)\nAfter several attempts to update the firmware of my 2020 PineTime from 13 to 14 I believe it\u0026rsquo;s time to switch back to my Casio F-91W. It was a fun ride and I wish all the maintainers well (and god(s) speed).\nSo many resolved 🔗Github issues too!\nFailed firmware updates has something to do with an Android 14 bug or something like that. From what I understand the 🔗issue is nearly resolved. Unfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;ve nearly broken through the glass at this point. As a teenager I broke the band of at least one G-Shock watch (oh he\u0026rsquo;s hard on watches this one).\n2001: My hand nearly slipped in between the seat and the table top of a picnic table while I was using the table \u0026hellip; just as it was made to be used of course, and the watch band popped off. I never lie you know ;)\nIn other news, people can totally live in the center of the Earth. Sure, that\u0026rsquo;s where diamonds were formed (or nearby), so living in the center of the Earth is totally possible. All you have to do is mine the pressure. You know, mine on and whatnot.\nWhatnot. \u0026lt;/storytime\u0026gt; *shrugs*\nJanuary 11, 2024 Fine Cinema ONLY THE BEST!\nSome of my first campy memories are of watching 🔗Tales from the Crypt from a Jacksonville, FL hotel (1989). Dad fell asleep, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t pull my eyes from the screen. Flying from Bermuda to Florida type jet lag. Probably avoided the 🔗Triangle, but still\u0026ndash;that\u0026rsquo;s a long dual flight trip (Bermuda \u0026gt; South Carolina \u0026gt; North Florida).\nI\u0026rsquo;m partial to the 🔗methane theory tbh\nIt\u0026rsquo;s definitely inherited, whatever it is that compels me to watch 🔗MST3K and movies that should be featured in future episodes (Toho Godzilla 🤞)\nIn the meantime I have a 🔗1995 Turkey Day Marathon to watch (complete with commercials!)\nIn other \u0026rsquo;news\u0026rsquo;, I finished the 🔗KinT controller after two years of dragging my feet. Actually, it\u0026rsquo;s been so long that there\u0026rsquo;s a new Kinesis Advantage 🔗keyboard. Not my style tbh\nSuper professional setup and the hotplate was plugged into a GFCI outlet (that I installed years ago) just in case\nNot sure if I cooked the components, but the board works.. so.. success? (neoprene pad on the keyboard hides the LEDs anyway)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll have a hotplate with temperature sensor for when I put together the backup controller. And since the Teensy 3.6 is 🔗no longer manufactured I placed a 4.1 in the same DigiKey 🔗BOM I used for the first KinT controller. It took a few minutes for the solder to liquify using the LED strip hot plate (I also had to remove two of the screws)\u0026ndash;slight anxst tbh\nANXST.\nOnce the second build is finished I\u0026rsquo;ll add it to the device/keyboard category of this website.\nCOMING SOON! 2030!\nJanuary 11, 2024 Financially Young Reddit | r/unixp0rn | [i3-gaps] A hint of lemon (08-14-2018)\nAfter three weeks of divine solitude work on a video game video recording side project, I was pushed away from my goal by a group of high-school sophomores. I was only partially at my goal (70 hours, or 2,500 out of the ~10K bound quest items needed). The game shrunk to a point in which these high-schoolers took it upon themselves to target anyone that moved\u0026ndash;especially those with a goal. I found the most efficient way to achieve my goal, and that really bugged them for some reason.\nSo it goes\nWhich brought me to an interesting thought. I keep running into this issue while in hobbyist realms. And it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I dialed in my ADHD symptoms that I got a clear picture of what I was dealing with. Young people assuming I am young too because of my financial situation/ADHD symptoms, and behaving as they would towards a poor peer. Especially poor \u0026lsquo;peers\u0026rsquo; that are organized and hyper focused on a goal.\nStill working on the ADHD symptoms tbh\nStopping me from the goal at that point in time effectively pushed me out of the game. I left on a polite high note, kept all my gear and accounts, and uninstalled the game (never to return again). I don\u0026rsquo;t have time for sophomore games. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time for them in the 10th grade, and I certainly don\u0026rsquo;t have time for those type of games 20 something years later.\n🎵 No-no time for games, she\u0026rsquo;s full grown 🎵\nAnyway, I won\u0026rsquo;t mention the game by name at this point in time as it\u0026rsquo;s not a safe place for like minded individuals to just go about their business. Shrunk population, and most of the positive minded individuals left years ago. Which is why I removed all mention of the game from this blog, and all of my social media accounts. I avoided global chats to avoid them and for whatever reason they got bored enough to show up in the zone I was working out of anyway. Grinding a few hours a day helped me focus on a single thing for a few hours. I can rarely do that effectively. What I saw and experienced was the type of unsafe that leads some to 🔗Dial 988. They don\u0026rsquo;t even understand how they\u0026rsquo;re projecting all over the place, and it\u0026rsquo;s dangerous.\nI can probably say that I think like an engineer at this point right?\nAnyway, so the point I\u0026rsquo;m getting at is that Florida\u0026rsquo;s/FDA\u0026rsquo;s decision to 🔗import medicine directly from Canada is a step in the right direction. I don\u0026rsquo;t qualify for government assistance; I haven\u0026rsquo;t since November 2012, but maybe it\u0026rsquo;ll help those that need it more.\nSuch things as 🔗Aspiration Bars never brushed my mind until I was in my late 30s tbh (good stuff)\nAnd if any of them are actually grown and step on the porch of this house I\u0026rsquo;m typing from, I hope they are prepared to take a nap. I may be an optimist, have a goofy face, and joke around a bunch, but I will lose all sense of self to protect my family. Just a friendly warning. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a few of those naps when I was younger, and those naps are less fun than a nap on a couch\u0026ndash;I can say that much.\nObviously, I\u0026rsquo;m avoiding all multi-player games moving forward. Skyrim AE is a better investment imo. Had to pull a few things out my mind to move forward via this blog post. Apologies for the personal clutter\nPlus there are a lot of social norms I missed out on that the average suburbanite observes without leaving their realm of safety. That may have been another piece of the puzzle that I was missing out on.\nAwkward-ing all over the place is my specialty tbh. No tact. Only wit and guile, but I\u0026rsquo;m working on it\nJanuary 21, 2024 Dangerous Aliexpress TMW: Looking for silicone thermal pads and you get the age verification pop-up \u0026lt;\u0026rsquo;(-_-)'\u0026gt;\nSacrificial APC surge protectors. ALL OF THEM\n#forever #socereal #cringist #potatomanspeakith\nSeriously though, I\u0026rsquo;ve never been so stoked to see these 🔗mini consoles. From what I can tell the screens are driven by mini Arduino based chips. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how many users are aware that they own the cutest web servers, because that\u0026rsquo;s the function of Model #NZ1237. You access the itty bitty server via web portal. That\u0026rsquo;s just to configure the customizable display options. If it can display an image, it can display an itty bitty custom webpage. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s my theory anyway.\nFirmware? idk\nWatch out for the Aliexpress coins thing tho. Definitely some time gotchas built-in to the app\nBejeweled. Gottem.\nJanuary 29, 2024 Thy Spooky Self Imgur description from 2019: \u0026ldquo;The Andorian First Officer that never was \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThat was how I was living five years ago. I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel like typing out all the specifications. What chair, how many parts of the chair still functioned, what my bed situation was like, etc. There are people living in the same city, state, country, and planet that would LOVE to have the setup shown in the picture.\nWell, maybe not in the planet. That\u0026rsquo;s not how that works\nSometimes I feel like I don\u0026rsquo;t deserve any of it. I\u0026rsquo;m this technological fraud because nothing on this website belongs to me. I use an AI generated image because I\u0026rsquo;m too lazy to create my own, and this website was created from a Hugo template because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to teleport myself back to 1999, which was when I learned how write HTML pages and how to implement 🔗applets or web forums. Also the living situation, which I myself and I would have scoffed at eleven years ago. I feel I don\u0026rsquo;t deserve that either. But here I am, dealing with it, by crawling under the house and stuff.\nAPPLETS! Web forums! The collapse of the Dot.Com bubble! Crawling under the hwhat?\nI recently finished reading R.L. Stine\u0026rsquo;s biography 🔗\u0026ldquo;It Came From Ohio: My Life As A Writer\u0026rdquo;. While yes the book was written for children, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of interesting mile markers along the way. Also, I was a child when the book was written. So, uh, nostalgia? Right, for one mile marker, R.L. Stine mentions that he spent so much time as an awkward observer rather than a participant, that it was natural for him to continue doing so to research and flesh out his characters. I mean, he is a father, and he did mention he watched a lot of TV. When I was reading Goosebumps books as a kid (most likely all of 1-50 at least once), I was reading from the perspective of this mythical middle class lifestyle I knew nothing about, and that forbidden knowledge helped shape who I am now. So naturally, I appreciates all that research.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what editors would say about these pages.\n\u0026ldquo;These words \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; *twitchy jestures*\nAnyway, I\u0026rsquo;m going to make an honest attempt to scoop up all the songs in the music blog and create a YouTube playlist.

I respectfully do not recommend. What I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed with mine is that the e-ink display refresh leaves artifacts behind from previous frames. A quick 10-15 minute rest in the freezer seems to fix the issue by returning the e-ink display to black. Which is great, but fades back to grey-ish after warming up. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the issue is overheating or a randomly glitchy firmware update. The screen of mine dims in color because most of the artifacts left behind from previous repaints are of the white repaint used to simulate refreshing the screen.\nDa screen.\nSleep tracking for 🔗PineTime in 2024? Oh, and my Fossil Hybrid watch face developed an aged look on the e-ink display due to condensation build-up. Not even suitable in shower steam or any steam. Eat and prepare ramen with your opposite hand or something idk.\nBefore freezer \u0026rsquo;treatment\u0026rsquo; and after freezer \u0026rsquo;treatment\u0026rsquo;\nPineTime to the rescue! It\u0026rsquo;s a watch that does a few things (music, notifications, timers, stopwatch, etc.). At the moment the stopwatch works for tracking my time while working. I bought two of them, so technically I have a backup once I unbrick the first one I bought a few years ago (whoops\u0026ndash;switching from WaspOS to IniniTimeOS did not work out as planned). I wish there was a toggle to disable touch controls. It\u0026rsquo;s water resistant, just not functionally sound in the rain (which is why I bought a Fossil Hybrid\u0026ndash;smh). If I could lock out the PineTime screen somehow with a three button press or whatever that would be pretty awesome. Or just to disable to touchscreen. Ghost input will occasionally clear timers and the stopwatch (long arm hairs).\nTo be fair, I\u0026rsquo;m RMA\u0026rsquo;in my Fossil Hybrid for the sake of sleep tracking. And I\u0026rsquo;m not worried about Alexa spying on me, because that feature via the watch is so basic it\u0026rsquo;s barely functional\nOh, and the 🔗inverted colors anomaly of my PineTime watch appeared after charging.\nMain screen with PineTimeStyle watch face and inverted colors\nUser menu screen with inverted colors\nDevice settings screen with inverted colors\nNo comment section via Disqus because I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to babysit this website. I may tap into my middle school self and redesign the website off HTML5 though. Browsed the Defcon website a few times the past few days and realized how kooky this site must look to security professionals. Another Git branch, another dive into HTML. Suppose I could dust off Inkscape and work on the site icons too.\nNot that this site has any influence. No delusions of grandeur here. A few OK Computers tho ;)\nDecember 17, 2023 Loneliness \u0026ldquo;Dude, do you even have a table under all those stickers?!\u0026rdquo; This clipboard is one of a handful of my things that survived the past 23 years.\nCurrently waiting on a Japanese copy of one of my favorite albums to ship from Japan. Super stoked to have a copy of those instrumentals as well as the album. As of 2024 all songs posted to the 🔗music blog will accompany a physical album. And to be fair, the one 🔗vinyl album I posted was a fluke. I ordered a CD copy and received a vinyl copy. Maybe they were out of CD copies and I got a bonus for being a loyal consumer?\n\u0026ldquo;Breh, do you even purposefully purchase vinyl records?\u0026rdquo; Uh, yes?\nSo yea, I\u0026rsquo;ve been alone for eleven years. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried to strike up a dialog occasionally, but most of my conversations were turned into entertainment value. So now when I think about sending a private message, I see that message being passed around to all their woman friends as a source of stress relief. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;m going out in the world enough to bump into the love of my life or anything. Which brings me to another point\u0026ndash;yes I have, and I wish I hadn\u0026rsquo;t. I thought I knew what love was, but it was never reciprocated in a way that makes me feel ok.\nEntertainment value like what I imagine takes place when a woman receives a \u0026lsquo;dic pic\u0026rsquo;\nFerociously independent is one of the ways of which I describe myself. Group activities were never my strong suit either. Kind of ties into me being terribly independent. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not the way you do it.\u0026rdquo; When I hear that my mind races to find the source of why that was spoken. Are they asserting dominance? Are they factual and desperately logical? Or are they regurgitating something they have heard from a TV show? Couple those thoughts with my financial constraints and there\u0026rsquo;s a decision that must be made. Do I waste valuable resources (calories) on this interaction? Or do I move on and appear like someone that is selfish and disinterested in the group arrangement? Typically I move on and appear like someone that is selfish and uninterested in group conjunctions.\nHeadaches burn away valuable calories as well (years of poor, etc.)\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re probably gay.\u0026rdquo; Nah, I lived in South Florida for two years. If I was gay people would know I was gay. I saw plenty of people living openly, and marveled at their courage. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine being in a relationship that could easily be undone by external forces. In fact, I won\u0026rsquo;t go into detail for the sake of respect for my family, but a relative took his life because he was gay. It\u0026rsquo;s not something I take lightly, and I will viciously defend against bigotry of that nature.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; Yea, because you didn\u0026rsquo;t care enough to know.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s like a warrior monk or something.\u0026rdquo; Nah, I like tearing apart rotisserie chickens far too much to be a monk. I\u0026rsquo;m just a dude looking for someone to share his life with. Someone that would watch me play with my childish fingerboard and smile because she knows I\u0026rsquo;m meditating. Someone that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t rush to my aid at the first sign of provocation or stress. Someone that would fight side by side with me during those meddlesome teenage years of parenthood. I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in joining for the sake of appeasing loneliness.\n#RotisserieChickens4lyfezYo\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s trying to be a rapper.\u0026rdquo; Now this is an interesting one. Actually, it really isn\u0026rsquo;t. This is a montage of white men from suburban environments looking back at their \u0026lsquo;rapper\u0026rsquo; phase and mistaking that for what I\u0026rsquo;m going through. I had to walk and talk a certain way because that was what was expected of me in my environment. When I walked home from school, I was immersed in it. Rappers from that area were forged, without an ounce of baby fat left on them. To walk or talk anyway different would paint a target on my back, and an easy to follow path to the door of the family trailer. Which some pounded on at 2am-3am in the morning looking for a \u0026hellip; lost love. Wearing a tie dye Goosebumps shirt was my only connection to the middle class lifestyle. And I only got away with it because people thought I smoked weed.\nDuring the 7th grade, I switched to a middle school in the city, and my first thought was: \u0026ldquo;My god, they all still have their baby fat.\u0026rdquo;\nI played 21 on a half court with a chain net, because the local boys kept stealing the rope net to get back at me for not joining their gang. Because of them I know what it sounds like to play 21 on a court with a chain net. Sounded like Machinima Jam or something.\n🎵People are strange when you\u0026rsquo;re a stranger🎵\nDecember 22, 2023 Happy Holidays Tetra Pak hugging robot\nNext year I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to keep a positive tone in this blog.\nHoping to put this X270 Thinkpad through some paces via tech certifications too\nRegardless of the somber tones echoed from this blog, 2023 was a great year, and hopefully 2024 will be even better. With that said, hope everyone reading and not reading this blog have happy times this holiday season.\nSteve The Lamp says happy holidays as well ;)\nDecember 25, 2023 To New Beginnings It\u0026rsquo;s like a rough life draft or something\nBusy dealing with a backlog of shows to organize and shift over to Jellyfin at the moment. Thought I would take a break to re-establish my intentions as a person. While I am totally going to watch some old cartoon favorites and read the first edition Goosebumps collection, my thoughts moving forward will only be about the future. No more nods to people from my past that have helped me along but are no longer in my life.\nThank you.\nI need to clear my thoughts and focus on how to get myself out of this mess. An apartment and a dog has been the goal for decades now, and maybe I can make that a reality if I can just let go of the past and focus on the future. Cannabis is taking the back seat at the moment. I\u0026rsquo;m also wearing boots with bootstraps, so maybe those will help.\nMy boots have two bootstraps per boot, which is like pretty sweet for pulling myself up stuff\nI squeaked a few songs in to the music blog without buying the CD mostly due to time constraints. I bought the digital offering because there\u0026rsquo;s no way I\u0026rsquo;d get a CD shipped from the UK in time for the holidays. And btw, I never thought I\u0026rsquo;d have a favorite laptop until I bought the X270. Little did I know it also has a touch screen. So awesome. Now to upgrade the batteries and RAM lol.\nRemoving Steam off the X270 has been so much of a challenge (Snapcraft) that I may have to reinstall the OS. Kubuntu is worth it IMO\nAnyway, I think that about wraps up 2023. I hope everyone has a Merry Christmas and or Happy Holidays.

And I was totally and seriously 8 years old. I \u0026lsquo;invented\u0026rsquo; tricks that were invented around the time I was born. Instead of calling one of the tricks a 🔗tictac, I named it the wiggle worm. For that period in time my favorite album was a coin toss between the Batman Forever Soundtrack and the original Ghostbusters Soundtrack. As proof, there\u0026rsquo;s a few songs from that era in the 🔗~/Music/Blog. My original Ghostbusters Soundtrack was on cassette. That\u0026rsquo;s just how bracingly cool I was back then.\nThe Wiggle Worm will forever be my new nickname. You\u0026rsquo;re welcome internet.\nI never mentally grasped how to translate the physics of skateboarding in practice. But I was a participate for fourteen years before work life balance shifted the idea of injuries into the category of irresponsibility. I once did a very shakey 180 ollie down a six stair stairset at the local community college. I should have been a gap skater. I guess I was worried about becoming homeless from paying off hospital bills. A culmination of fourteen years of scrapped knees, elbows, and two busted wrists. There were a few attempts to 180 a seven stair somewhere in Downtown Gainesville (Florida); of course that was thwarted by the local police department.\nThe hoarders of skateboarding secrets scornfully looked on as I tried my best. Nearly certain I incidentally spawned the name of the local skateboard club known as \u0026lsquo;Lurk Nasty\u0026rsquo;. Lots of money was dumped into that endeavour. Hope it worked out for them\u0026ndash;seemed like a lot of fun.\nHundreds of skateboard magazines, dozens of videos, dozens of skateboard decks, and all far too late.\n🔗Pro stories often start with rolling around with friends, and sponsors taking notice a few years later\nSkateboarding wasn\u0026rsquo;t a given for me. It\u0026rsquo;s not something I knew would be there when I stepped off the school bus. Some days I would unlock the back door to the house after school, and know I was coming home to a board I snapped yesterday. The first board that snapped was the last straw for my folks. I would sometimes go months without skating after snapping a board. It frustrated me to the point of selling all my video games and consoles to pay for skate decks.\nNES, SNES, 🔗DMG Gameboy, Genesis, and my beloved Playstation 1. \u0026ldquo;Oh yah, he\u0026rsquo;s hard on shoes that one.\u0026rdquo;\nIt was something I thought about all day. It was what I was thinking about when I was looking out any window I would find while in class. For the classrooms with few windows, I looked inward instead. I believe one person noticed me looking at my math textbook book on top my uncomfortable desk. My gaze would have been as if the words of the book were 100 yards away. At first, I would try to comprehend the words, but my inner ambitions took over, and off my mind went; imagining how it would feel like to skate around the middle school. Nice new slabs of concrete. The thump of the wheels rolling over each gap in the pavement. And then my oversized pants would wrap up into the wheels, and there I\u0026rsquo;d go, spiraling out of control in my own daydream.\nSkating around my middle school was literally a dream of mine. Shoot for the stars right?\nThe first board break happens simply because learning to land flip tricks exerts a lot of downward force on a glued stack of maple veneer. Oh course, when I did it, I landed in the middle of the board with all my weight on my front foot. I never purposely broke (AKA focused) a skateboard. There was a serious disconnect between what I said, and what my folks believed back then.\nI thought I was mobbing varial flips. What I was actually doing was dolphin flips *shrugs*\nI am now 39 years old, and it still pains me to think of all the fun I could have had, had my folks taken my interest in skateboarding seriously. Of course, this was after two years of carting around my boney self for baseball games and practice, and one eviction, so my story is a little different.\n39 YEARS YOUNG! YOOOOOOO-LO!\nThere was also a knowledge disconnect at the time. My folks were reluctant to believe words on the internet. Whatever they learned about skateboarding outside of conversations with me (unbelievable conversations), where from action sports events like the X-Games. Professionals that land bolts all the time (feet over the axles/trucks). Accidentally breaking a board was inline with the legend of Nessie.\nX-Games \u0026lsquo;street\u0026rsquo; skatepark was more like a skatepark for vert dogs. Daewon Song still rips tho\nAll the magazines, and videos I \u0026lsquo;consumed\u0026rsquo; were of street skating. A form of skateboarding in which there were fewer rules, a chance for handcuffs and an arrest record, but was more accessible to the average skateboarder. This also suited my ADHD temperament. The only skate park within a reasonable distance for a self starter youth was inaccessible, because it was part of a \u0026lsquo;club\u0026rsquo; for the local university. In my town there was a real life chance of handcuffs and jail time for skating at a skatepark while young. That only stopped us until several police officers were called to kick us youths out of the park. I was sixteen, and at that point in time had only been to one other skatepark. A local rented a warehouse behind a Tacobell. The place smelled like a Christmas tree from all the unpainted pine wood, and it was only open for about a year. And at $5-10/day, it was not a place I could go skate at everyday. Flipside Skatepark (owned by Billy Rohan, and possibly Harold Hunter). Technically it was a pile of ramps and flatbar rails there were dragged out onto a tennis court every Thursday night. The local skateshop had a few flatbars for the locals too. Fluid Skateshop \u0026gt; Smoke Skateshop.\nOne time I read and re-read skateboarding magazines while I waited overnight at Toronto Pearson Airport. \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;the [blah blah blah] is for unloading and loading only\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAt sixteen was when I realized skateboarding itself wasn\u0026rsquo;t something I could do as a career. Which was far later in the game than most people my age. I should have known this before I turned twelve. But I kept pushing forward with my obsession. Funds were tight, and there were hundreds of arguments. Had no control over my day dreams in class, and most teachers gave up trying to call my attention back to class after the first semester.\nPoor sporting arguments. Use to envy those that could fall asleep in class. I had a backpack to guard\u0026ndash;couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nThere was a pushing force in the back of my mind that I\u0026rsquo;d later call ADHD that took over at a certain age, and made me realize that an early dream of becoming a Herpetologist was not a realistic goal. And so I pivoted to a dream of joining the U.S. Air Force. The idea of having my body subjected to the torture of flying in a jet was very appealing at the age of eight. It\u0026rsquo;s still one of the reasons I play first person shooter video games. Maps like 🔗DM-Morpheus (Unreal Tournament) come to mind\u0026ndash;because flying. I was really excited about the prospect of signing up in ten years, and I guess I was so overeager that my father decided to test my resolve by regurgitating what he heard during basic training (from the early 70s). Since I was decent at catching a baseball, and had an awful batting average, and wasn\u0026rsquo;t capable of wrapping my head around surviving basic training (I would have excelled and learned computer science), my mind fully and totally pivoted to skateboarding. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to skate down Dead Man\u0026rsquo;s Curve one day. I promise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Breh, you\u0026rsquo;re eight years old, how are you even going to survive basic training? Do you even basic training maggot lips?\u0026rdquo; Wait.. what?\nWhen I saw that a new skateboard video review website was taking applications my sophomore year of high school for reviewers, I jumped on the chance. I wrote a three paragraph essay, and got a spot on their 🔗review roster. In a few weeks, a package of bright yellow tapes with handwritten labels were in my hands. With one package shipped free, my skateboard video collection grew by 90%. I was the original Granitesoul. I guess someone got out of jail and decided to bogart that handle while I was busy graduating high school. During the first semester of my senior year of high school I dropped out of reviewing for Skim The Fat (never liked that exclusionary name). I could either drop out of skateboarding, or drop out of high school. At the time I was also a fan of 🔗Bad Religion (which explains my Skimthefat.com profile picture).\nWhen I was 16 I kickflipped in socks after a kid at our high school said he couldn\u0026rsquo;t skate my board because he wasn\u0026rsquo;t wearing his \u0026lsquo;skate shoes\u0026rsquo;. He also threatened students in one of my middle school classes. I was duty bound to wreck my socks.\nWith all that said, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty good at pretending I\u0026rsquo;m fluent in English.\nPortioning out my weaknesses for the deranged 🔗pretendy-times since 1997.\nIf someone asked me if I skate today I\u0026rsquo;d say no. I\u0026rsquo;m no longer a skateboarder. That lifestyle drained out of me a long time ago.\nThough I still see skate spots while driving around or watching TV. I can\u0026rsquo;t help it.\nWhile I was still a lifestyle skateboarder at heart, I also started to teach myself table top skateboarding (fingerboarding). Learning how to ollie on a fingerboard accompanied 🔗28.8 baud modem sounds. At the time I was also teaching myself Photoshop, HTML, Quake 1 level editing and modding, and how to create Windows 98 sound themes (my brother\u0026rsquo;s partner at the time was thrilled with the new and very custom Beavis and Butthead sound theme). I learned a few tricks while waiting for instructional web pages to load.\nThe most difficult aspect of table top skateboarding is putting on the finger pants and finger shoes tbh. I\u0026rsquo;m one of the few to forego finger elbow and knee pads. I just like to go for it you know? \u0026ldquo;Whaaaaat?!\u0026rdquo; Also, Orcas are 🔗gnarly.\nFrom outsiders of table top skateboarding, I was a kook. It was also a great past time to separate myself from women that were only interested in my mad wood chopping skills.\nHow many different and unique skills are involved in act of wood chopping? \u0026ldquo;Stay a while, and listen.\u0026rdquo; Probably a lot, I have no idea.\nJust after high school, I had moved out of the apartment I staid at with my high school sweetheart, and her family. I found myself sharing a room with a long time friend, which was pretty cool. I had sent out a digital form of my demo tape to a fingerboard deck company out of Las Vegas, Nevada. This was before I transitioned from using a webcam to a S-VHS camera. I taught myself a little about video montages, and digitizing analog videos too.\n5-0 pivot nosegrind, nollie flip 5-0, and hardflip 5-0 were kind of advanced back then\nI found myself in a community of like minded people. We drilled out a hole in our Tech Deck trucks, slipped in a probably ok single axle, and used a tap and die set to thread the ends. Back then here was a decent amount of elbow grease that went into being able to use a fingerboard for more than thirty minutes without them falling apart. I borrowed my fathers mini manual drill for the job.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you even single axle trucks breh?\u0026rdquo;\nSwitching to working full time, and dating someone that lived in Toronto, Ontario, Canada skidded my pro fingerboarding status to a halt.\nActually *adjusts imaginary glasses*, I filmed a pro level video part, but once I learned the video would be known as Amerikkka, I forfeited my fingerboarding \u0026lsquo;career\u0026rsquo;. I talked to one of the dudes that became a fixture in what is known as the fingerboard community back when he was this big nosed 15 year old working out of his father\u0026rsquo;s garage. I was jealous of his mad skills tbh\nTo be fair, the pay would have been like $2-5 a board. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how it is now, but back then we designed our own board graphics, and the only professional fingerboarding equipment was all manufactured in Germany (~$300 for a complete fingerboard shipped to USA).\nMy design was really, really, bad. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say it was better for all of humanity that I never turned pro. I also included a very 🔗dissociative (to me) song in one of my contest submission videos. We also made all of our obstacles out of card board, and can-do-attitude scraps of whatever we could find. I made a big stair-set out of stacked, glued, and painted particle board, and a meticulously bent 5mm rod of nickle coated zinc.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s something I do now as a form of meditation. Meditation that involves a hint of practical physics.\n\u0026ldquo;How about a hint of git off your high horse and mix me another cocktail.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Breh, do you even Cosmopolitan?\u0026rdquo;\nAll these monies I\u0026rsquo;m saving from not drinking, binge snacking, energy drinks, or cigarettes has to be put to good use right?\n\u0026ldquo;Breh, how many Starbucks is that fingerboard even worth?\u0026rdquo; Elevendy Starbucks my friends. Elevendy Starbucks.\nThere really was a somewhat logical line of thought involved in joining the world of skateboarding. And it all hinged off the idea that only way to continue my education (Air Force) was off limits.\nMy eight year old self still can\u0026rsquo;t watch Top Gun without thinking about how different my life would have been. If given the chance to go back in time, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t change a thing.\nAnyway, that\u0026rsquo;s my story behind the picture of the book I\u0026rsquo;ve included with this blog post.\n\u0026ldquo;Breh, can you even ride down Dead Man\u0026rsquo;s Curve now that you\u0026rsquo;re all grown up?\u0026rdquo; Nope, not even a little bit.\nNovember 24, 2023 Meet: Steve The Lamp This is Steve The Lamp, and as you can see, he really does light the way.\nSteve The Lamp just needs a USB conversion cord, and an RGB LED (smart bulb), and he\u0026rsquo;ll be set.\nAlexa, turn on Steve please.. *Orc-ish chuckles*\nIn other non-Steve The Lamp related news, I may have found the \u0026lsquo;fix\u0026rsquo; for this Avantree Oasis Plus Bluetooth transmitter I have on the desk. You see, under the rectangular non-skid rubber pad are four screws (one in each corner). With the correct plastic spudger it\u0026rsquo;s simple enough to pop the transmitter open. Once the case is open just need to remove the two screws that secure the antenna PCB in place. With that PCB removed, we have access to the micro RF cable connector. Unplug the cable, and tuck it safely away from PCB components. Bluetooth static issue fixed. This idea came to being after reading Amazon reviews for the 🔗Sennhesier BT T100\u0026ndash;which does not have an external antenna. The antennae increased the range to like a 1/4 acre (0.1 hectares for those across the pond), which is well beyond an acceptable 20-30ft. If I was to order a new one, I\u0026rsquo;d 100% order the Sennheiser tbh.\n\u0026ldquo;Where\u0026rsquo;s the video!?\u0026rdquo; Steve The Lamp is working on it ok? Give him time. His videos are works of art you know.\nNovember 25, 2023 Well, Mr. Pimpkins is worth it ok? Mr. Pimpkins puts on a show\nAlright, hear me out. My idea is a device that looks like an Amazon Echo with a motion detection activated camera. While that is not particularly interesting, what if the motion detector of this device FaceTimes your phone, so you can talk to your cat? In essence, Mr. Pimpkins can learn how to FaceTime you whenever it gets bored or lonely.\nMr. Pimpkins can now meow at you to fill its\u0026rsquo; bowl from miles away!

Something with a few more PCIE lanes, capture card, and 64GB-128GB RAM would be pretty sweet. Ten years of online PC gaming as a real boy and I\u0026rsquo;m thinking an actual gaming PC might be a worthwhile investment.

DIE!\nNavy brat signing out ftm.\nOctober 13, 2023 Car for a home Since this blog is all about me feeling that I really have nothing to lose anymore, I may as well talk about what it was like to live out of a car in Florida for a few months. To be clear, I\u0026rsquo;m not proud of any of this. I was just dealing with life in the only way I knew how.\nThe summer of 2009 in South Florida was slightly breezy, but mostly hot. My mobile journey started with a dip in the hot tub of the apartment complex I was evicted from. May as well enjoy a little creature comfort before whatever comes next.\nI placed as much of my stuff into my car as I could, which at first meant I couldn\u0026rsquo;t recline the drivers seat. Palm Beach county was not kind to those sleeping in Walmart parking lots, so after a few days, I had to relocate to the parking lot of the central Walmart of Pompano Beach. This was shortly after being asked \u0026ldquo;Have you ever been arrested before?\u0026rdquo; because I made the grave mistake of falling asleep near a public porta-potty. I rented a motel room once a week to shower and stretch me legs. I think I was \u0026lsquo;on the lamb\u0026rsquo; for a week before I got rid of my record collection so that I could recline the drivers seat. This was also when I remembered that my father taught me how to roll my clothes. Which was important in preventing wrinkles.\nI may have been mistaken, but I thought the trick to living out of your car was to drive until sundown, and find a place to sleep. So that\u0026rsquo;s what I did. I drove from the time I got off (7pm), until sundown. Putting way too much wear on my Honda hatchback with 300K+ miles. Another trick I was so sure of was to keep a food that won\u0026rsquo;t spoil easily in the heat. Dry roasted peanuts for the win right? At least that kept my bowels on a schedule to avoid going into Walmart as much as possible. What I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize was that the salt and the heat was a bad combination.\nSummer in Florida is also the rainy season. Did I mention the car did not have working air conditioning? Converting the A/C system from R22 to R134 kind of slipped my mind during a relationship breakup, and me feeling stranded in a city with very few friends. My second year in a motorist\u0026rsquo;s metropolis and I\u0026rsquo;m sleeping with the windows rolled down in the back of a Walmart parking lot. One stormy night in particular comes to mind. I decided that I needed to roll the windows up, because my stuff was getting wet. Save the stuff at all costs right? Even if it\u0026rsquo;s raining, and breezy, a person generates a lot of heat. And with the windows rolled up, there\u0026rsquo;s no place for that heat to expel. Obviously it was hot and humid, but I thought about the rain causing mold and other issues, so I thought I\u0026rsquo;d risk falling asleep with a little discomfort. After a while I stopped sweating. That was my first warning sign. I experienced that several times as an HVAC mechanic, so I should have known better. My breathing was slowing and so was my comprehension of the situation. My eyes closed, and that\u0026rsquo;s when my mind told me to roll down the windows. A quick burst of strength returned when I realized that if I fall asleep, I might never wake up. After that, I only had one incident that resulted from me sleeping with the windows rolled down. All I could assess the next morning was that a stream of liquid went over the window, over my seat-belt, on my lap, and on the seat. At least, this is what I noticed when I woke up. Whatever it was filled the car with the smell of ammonia. Adding to the weekly stink of saving money by not renting a hotel room everyday for $50 a night. One bottle of Febreze later and queue the chemical smell headaches.\nAt first I thought the only people that would talk to me would be the police. I have a hard time thinking I was truly homeless after one person stopped by to talk about picking out the right cardboard box. That conversation was cool, so I was more relaxed for the next conversation. Unfortunately, I said too much. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the person I was talking to was evaluating a mark or not, so I left that parking lot never to return. There was too much of the old neighborhood in my mind to feel safe staying at the parking lot. After all, this was within the time frame of hearing a gun shot ring out as I switched my clothes from a washing machine to a drying machine off the corner of Powerline and Sample. That was a tiny strip mall, and a very loud gun. I think the crime tape was only up for a day; probably an open and shut case.\nSo, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t all. I had found a studio apartment for rent for $650/month, but I was a little short on the deposit. This was also during a time when I was very impulsive with my money, smoked cigarettes, and planning for the future meant thinking about what I\u0026rsquo;ll do on my next day off. If I remember correctly, I\u0026rsquo;d rent a motel room on my days off. Instead of finding another retail parking lot, I actually slept at the parking lot of where I worked. Maybe for a few weeks. I\u0026rsquo;d change my clothes everyday in the drivers seat with a towel draped over my legs. Which wasn\u0026rsquo;t awkward until I was near my co-workers. I tried to keep it all quiet, so no one would know, though I think they figured it out when I started smelling after the first week.\nSo when I say I can sleep anywhere, and that sleeping on a yoga mat on a tile floor was like finding a slice of heaven, this is kind of what I mean. Oh, and I read a bunch of books to pass the time.\nI\u0026rsquo;m starting a petition to rename all vegetarian chicken to Chim\u0026rsquo;kn. Just cuz\nOctober 16, 2023 I\u0026rsquo;ll think of something interesting 2018 photo of a Nintendo DS R4 cart loaded with DSx86 (DOS emulator) running Commander Keen 4: Goodbye Galaxy\nTo be honest, I prefer Commander Keen via Magic DOS and a Razer Kishi controller.\nGASP!\nComputer was down from last night till 4pm today as I hammered away fixing GRUB. It was caused by an honest effort to tidy up a laminated sandwich of partitions. I was within working hours from 8am to 4pm, which is a first for me. Also a first for attempting to fix EFI GRUB. Dozens of successful attempts fixing BIOS GRUB. I would include a link to the notes, but there are none. My solution was to install Kubuntu alongside Kubuntu because I knew the installer would create a GRUB partition detected by the system. Some drive space gained, as well as my sanity.\nHow many chroot attempts are too many?

I want the Valkyries to be proud of me.\n🎵 🔗 Valkyries will guide us home 🎵\nIt\u0026rsquo;s part flattering that people even remember that much of my life, and also part frustrating that people are so caught up in the past they can\u0026rsquo;t see the present for what it is. I\u0026rsquo;m not that person anymore. I know why I behaved the way I did, and now I am trying my best to maintain equilibrium. And I don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to deal with any in game atonement.

I was a decent kid though, just impulsive.\nThis happened so often I lost my dream of owning any vehicle. By the sixth grade I knew college wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option.\nInstead of repeating old mistakes, I left global in game chats on the 19th. I wish I had sage advice to those in the same situation, but I don\u0026rsquo;t. I don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers. Not all virtual worlds are the same anyway. What I can say is that I\u0026rsquo;ve had peace of mind for several days now. I believe I\u0026rsquo;m going to chase this feeling for the foreseeable future.\nAlert the media! He left the chats! oh no.\nTen years in the same spot. An hour away from the city and friends I once knew. Seven years praying to a god that never answered.

Thankfully, I now have some self checks to prevent my impulsive side from getting wrapped up in these rotten lines. Fortunately, my patience for dealing with video game personas has worn thin in the past ten years.

Same computer I use to work the side hustle, Jellyfin (10TB), and Nextcloud (500G). Developing this website too (lol). And it looks good on the 32-inch Samsung 4K monitor too (🔗 HiDPI scaling @ 150%).\nBought a dual monitor arm to eventually dual wield 2x 32-inch 4K monitors, but now I have regrets .. too much room for activities.\nA few complications while switching resolutions, but that\u0026rsquo;s most likely the increasing limitations of this here Nvidia K620. A quick restart resolves the complications. So it\u0026rsquo;s up to me to secure a Quadro P620 before prices soar again.\nSoar like my heart right after the oatmeal drops the beat\nWeird static noises showered through to my headphones without the Just Mixer attached to my janky two device one bluetooth headset setup. The inherent gain of the Just Mixer just boosts the noise. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to wear a static grounding wrist strap to make it stop, but there have been times when that seemed like the best solution. All this because I\u0026rsquo;ll occasionally forget I\u0026rsquo;m wearing headphones. Comedy ensues when I pull the computer across the desk like a god dang mule pulling a load of turnips to market.\nSeriously, there was no intention with the album cover. It was on my mind because it was one of the first albums I listened to in 2013.\nSeptember 19, 2023 Parasites They\u0026rsquo;re shorks you know\n🔗 Merriam-Webster: Parasite\nParasite : an organism living in, on, or with another organism in order to obtain nutrients, grow, or multiply often in a state that directly or indirectly harms the host\nParasites are creatures that thrive on using others. They have very little regard for the host, and want only what is best for themselves, because anything less would be inconceivable. Their demands will be heard above the demands of all others at all costs, and they are void of dreams or goals because their needs have already been met. If they were human, they would probably laugh in the face of people that say they\u0026rsquo;ll never retire.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll never retire. When I finally scrape together a ten year domain for this website you can take that last line to the bank.\nCalling someone a parasite is one of the lowest forms of insults. With a simple sentence a person is reduced to the least loved life forms on the planet. Which you might imagine is not fun for the person being called a parasite.\nHave you ever envisioned what it would feel like to succumb to a tick invasion because you lack the dexterity required to pluck them off your skin? Parasites are terribly destructive creatures, and to be called one is enough to send someone down a spiral of self doubt and despair.\n🔗 \u0026ldquo;How many vermin get to scurry up the piggy back And burrow in before it lose the personhood to sticky trap?\u0026rdquo; [NSFW]\nWith that said, this desk that I\u0026rsquo;m typing from does not belong to me. I did not create Visual Studio Code, nor did I create the Hugo theme or framework that I use every time I update this website. And the majority of my pet projects are like mix tapes made from Stack Overflow answers.\nThough most of the code logic of my pet projects came from talking to Tux the Penguin. So technically, I owe all of my accomplishments to a masonite penguin statue.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy this lifestyle. If there was something I could focus on long enough to pull myself out of this, I would. From 2020-2022 I had a remote job and funneled most of my earnings into improving my \u0026lsquo;office\u0026rsquo; so that I\u0026rsquo;m more prepared for future projects. And at the moment I am in between projects.\nFun Fact: DSL connections can be maintained for hours during certain power outages by using a simple 300W UPS.\nActually, I was looking through old emails yesterday, which kind of gave me the idea for this blog post. In 2010, I applied to Walmart, Toys R Us, CVS, Target, and several other places, and never heard back. At the time I had at least five years of active retail experience, and had only month long gaps in employment. I was employed as a gas station \u0026lsquo;attendant\u0026rsquo;, and I applied to different jobs to pull myself out of working overnights for two years, but nothing came from my efforts.\nFill out the two page job application, and submit. I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about jobs that require cover sheets or resumes here lol\nPeople officially diagnosed with ADD might be able to spot the pattern. Or maybe spot the cycle of rejection. Not only from lack of employment, but also from family and friends that think I\u0026rsquo;m just not putting in the effort to pull my own weight. I think anyone that has browsed my Facebook page would know that I am all for working hard to accomplish a goal. When the goals are inaccessible is when the self doubt really starts to eat away at the smile that interviewers are expecting to see in the first place.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not all bad though. Had I not gone through long term unemployment, I would not have the skills to have deployed this website. I tried Linux Mint in 2013 because I was bored to tears and tired of MS Windows. Actually, the truth is I was honestly convinced that Linux would outperform MS Windows. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s the framework for big name CGI tooling (Pixar).\nDuring the first minute of interviews, I\u0026rsquo;ve witnessed an interviewer prop their head up with their hand, fold both arms and legs, and one interviewer casually asked me all the boiler plate worksheet questions without facing me. They were interviewing me for a position at one of the CVS stores I once helped to transition from an Eckerd Drug store to a CVS Pharmacy store. I knew how to do the job lol. One interviewer was ten minutes late to the interview because they decided to chat with a friend instead of interviewing me (\u0026ldquo;Maybe he\u0026rsquo;ll just leave.\u0026rdquo;). Another interviewer smiled sardonically throughout the interview. I guess I was a ridiculous candidate for cleaning snake cages. The only advice handed to me by a friend was to drive for Uber - completely bypassing my personality and recommending a job that would trigger migraines. I mean, I watched friends get jobs from other friends while I was stuck on the sidelines. I don\u0026rsquo;t blame them, and I always appreciate feedback. ♫ 🔗 Well, I guess this is growing up ♫\n\u0026ldquo;Bermuda? Panama? What are you trying to pull? Are you not one of those meth people I\u0026rsquo;ve heard so much about lately?\u0026rdquo;\nI worked as a unqualified HVAC mechanic for six months. The work was grueling, which was expected. Eventually you learn how to deal with the fiberglass dust that embeds itself everywhere. I loved using tin snips, brazing, and the fabrication side of the job, but the industry had different expectations of how to mentor people, and what methods should be employed to help others develop new skills. We were a residential team that specialized in replacing older HVAC systems, so I did get to see a lot of interesting ways of life.\nGojo 957. Probably not great for the skin, but it helps to remove fiberglass dust\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not that I don\u0026rsquo;t know how interviews work, or that I\u0026rsquo;m not aware that I\u0026rsquo;m suppose to \u0026lsquo;put my best foot forward\u0026rsquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s that they look me up and down and write me off as a small block of time that they will never get back. I am the waste of space occupying the chair that the last occupant used to brighten the interviewer\u0026rsquo;s day.\nBlah, blah, blah. Fix my computer please.\nFeel free to send your hate mail to 🔗 csmertx@pm.me\nShortened Proton.me email address for filtering out spam\nSeptember 21, 2023 Solo YOLO A light bulb element hugging robot.\nI\u0026rsquo;m ok with being alone with myself. And I am comfortable with falling asleep nearly anywhere.\nBus benches, cars, buses, wood floors, desks (on/over), folding chairs, office chairs, love seats, couches, foldaway beds, folding beds, camping cots, futons, yoga mats, tile floors, carpets, skateboards as pillows, piers, big cities, little cities, covered parking lots, uncovered parking lots, never subway cars, random motel rooms, random apartments, random trailer park trailers, small planes, jumbo jets, bathrooms, and under the stars. Not romantically under the stars though, because I was alone, and a raccoon kept crawling under my chair.\nA little over a decade ago I staid (with permission) in the upper floor of what was once a pet shop slash living space in Chinatown of Toronto. Where many people go to university (or to hospital). The window blinds in the room I used to hide my duffel bag were left open. So when I grabbed my clothes every morning, I saw dozens of people going about their day. The population density didn\u0026rsquo;t really scare me after the initial culture shock. It was one of the few times in my life where I blended in to my environment. Yea, I was a weird white boy in Chinatown, but no one cared. Too many people to care. Besides, I\u0026rsquo;m no 🔗 Jason Tripitikas lol.\nThought provoking skateboard rides around the city while everyone slept were fun. Raccoons dotted the sidewalks, and were face first in the curbside trash bags just vibing on leftovers from the local restaurants and grocery stores. They also did not care. Most didn\u0026rsquo;t even look up as I skated past them. One of them burped and or growled at me a little tho.\nThose window peaking moments made me realize that deep down, I know I\u0026rsquo;m not a hermit. Also, those moments were a turning point in which Little Debbie snacks cakes are no longer enough to satisfy my deepest urges to sink my teeth into a spongy mass of happy chemicals.\nA bakery was in view. Which was where awesome people made the best cake sized swiss rolls. For millions of people this is just business as normal. Swiss rolls are cake sized. Full stop. But, for someone that grew up with little tiny swiss rolls.. sheeesh\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s why random strangers like to call me bossman.\nHwhat?\nAt this point I\u0026rsquo;m nearly certain that the unique combination of Avantree bluetooth transmitter and Adidas bluetooth headphones are the cause of the random static chirp like noises I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a $10 ground loop isolator made for wasting $10, and a $35 ground loop isolator made for musicians. One did nothing, while the other converted the audio to mono and added more noise (whoops). I\u0026rsquo;ve also tried switching the USB hub to a dedicated PCIE USB port. All signs point to an over zealous transmitter picking up all kinds of noise within a range of ~100FT. And placing my hand on the Just Mixer only isolates some of the noise momentarily. If I keep my hand on the Just Mixer, some of the louder clicks, whirrs, and pops flow to the headphones.\nI think the transmitter is attempting to send a distress signal out to the mother ship tbh (jk)\nSeptember 27, 2023 Dosing (Don\u0026rsquo;t try this at home kids) [NSFW?] Blur erased the hairs a bit, but they\u0026rsquo;re are on those buds I promise (~4 month to clear the tin)\nSupporting the unified rainbow front since the early 90s. Also, painter\u0026rsquo;s tape to secure the As Tips glass tip to the joint because I can\u0026rsquo;t roll for shit.\nThis is bong.\nPeople give CBD Hemp Direct a bad rap mostly because it\u0026rsquo;s too cheap for some to trust. Sure, the spraying method sputters and does not evenly distribute Delta 8 oil, but it\u0026rsquo;s fun to have impromptu adventures right?\nFight through the pain Harold face as I play MMORPGs, Schmups, and FPSs.\nAll kidding aside, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to disclose my usage to show just how responsible I am with the stuff. I have a micro digital kitchen scale, and use it everyday. I mean, this stuff is CBD based hash oil sprayed 2x on CBG flower buds (it can be intense). Also here\u0026rsquo;s a friendly reminder: Half Baked was released 25 years ago. You\u0026rsquo;re welcome.\nThis is the fun part where I turn a bad boy recreational pass time into plain ole dumb geeky science.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to end every sentence with a period. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to use the uppercase letters and the full paid version of words. Because that\u0026rsquo;s how adult this post is going to be. Pretty sweet right?\nBig CBD is knocking at your door .. what do you do?\nAlright, hopefully this will be a quick one. Dosing hence force specifically for bongs (cleaned about once a week). The peak of the effects I experience hits within 35 minutes, and will last from 2-4 hours depending on the dosage.\nThat Formula 710 cleaner gets the job done on tough to clean pieces tho.

Probably on par with a 1.2g joint. Irresponsible time.\nThere are times when work must be done, and the upper range causes focusing discrepancies for me. So it goes.\nHIDE THE PAIN VIDEO GAME TIME (via bong \u0026gt; 11pm - 2:00am)\n35mg+ (less than twice a month)\nBeyond 35mg I am full tilt in my head. My eyes are bloodshot, and I am fighting off the feeling of passing out. I rarely go beyond 35mg, because when I do I feel like a useless hunk of space trash. At some point I\u0026rsquo;ll actually apologize out loud for smoking so much at once. I might even start taking to the masonite penguin on this desk. His name is tux. There. See how science ruins everything? You\u0026rsquo;re welcome.\nI use a bong because it just feels right. I don\u0026rsquo;t mess around with herb grinders either. A pair of decent tweezers, a curved rectangular sticker (Art Primo godzilla stickers), a few tiny jam jars, micro digital scale, and a heavy af magnetic parts tray. To be honest, if I could plop the magnetic parts tray on to an iron table I\u0026rsquo;d feel much better. Hidable plant tray built into the desk you say? Interesting. Very interesting ..\nI\u0026rsquo;ll just don my jeweler\u0026rsquo;s headgear and tweeze the night away. Full plop.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also writing this post because Florida is heavy handed when it comes to substances that are not part of Florida heritage (alcohol). So uh, if I\u0026rsquo;m raided, I have confirmation that my stuff is legal.\nNope, too much science. Not allowed.

Pretty sure I read at least 50 of the first series Goosebumps books before 1998. It\u0026rsquo;s all about the embossing tbh.\nJust an ordinary tuna fish sandwich. Nothing to see here. Move along (all with stolen ingredients \u0026hellip; oh no).\nStill zooming along with Kubuntu 23.04 as my main operating system. My side hustle might not make me rich, but it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been interrupted by any technical difficulties. Though it would be irresponsible of me not to mention that 23.04 is NOT a long term release OS, and it is running on a tried and tested Thinkcentre M73 (w/pupgrades). Best case scenario sans running an Nvidia Quadro K620 in 2023 (oof? oof.).\nFossil FTW7074 Hybrid Watch Update:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fine. Pressing the Alexa button and saying, \u0026ldquo;cancel timer\u0026rdquo;, brings me to an nearly inescapable timer app. Which seems very unintuitive for a voice activated watch. The watch also still drops the Bluetooth signal while the phone is less than 3FT away. Possibly caused by my Avantree Oasis bluetooth transmitter. Sometimes making it difficult to set different timers. Yep, µAlexa requires an uplink to a server to function, go figure right?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been secretly working on isolating a ground loop crackle coming from the M73. It travels up the stereo cable from the PC, through the two channel Just Mixer headphone mixer, and through the transmitter to my bluetooth headphones. The obvious choice is to buy a decent sound card, which I will probably do once I open it up the M73 again and see how the PCIE cards are arranged. I figured it\u0026rsquo;s a ground loop issue because I can stop it by placing my hand on the connector housing of the input cable connected to the mixer (hand on mixer make work good). It might just be a bad cable, but in this instance, I have a good excuse to buy a new sound card.\nI know I\u0026rsquo;m caught up in nostalgia hype, and Gen-Z\u0026rsquo;rs are most likely profiting off my youth, but for a few seconds the other day I could imagine what it was like to walk out of the door of the family home in 1997. I could SMELL the open shed of .. bagged beverage cans as well. I guess the wind shifted during my recollection.\nAugust 15, 2023 Vim forever 2017 was my year with Vim, i3wm, Manjaro/Arch Linux. Vim can be seen in the top right window.\nI never knew 🔗 Bram Moolenaar (creator of 🔗 Vim). To be fair, I don\u0026rsquo;t get out much, so that could be part of it. Though I can\u0026rsquo;t speak of Moolenaar or of his character, I can say that Vim helped me organize my thoughts in a way I never thought possible. At this point in my late thirties, I\u0026rsquo;m nearly certain I have some form of attention deficit disorder. The major shift in organizing my life began in 2017 once I obtained confidence with Vim. The text editor melted away, and I could do what I wanted to do at the speed I wanted to do it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a spot in my main Tmuxinator config file for a combination life journal and system maintenance log that I type in everyday (created: December 16, 2017 @ 6:13pm). Which was created using Vim, and updated using Vim. All the pet project scripts I\u0026rsquo;ve written since 2017 were created using Vim. It is one of the first programs I install on a new system, and it is the program I miss the most when I\u0026rsquo;m using Vi.\nIf I wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a monster of a visual person, I would be using Vim to type this blog entry. Previewing markup files using Vim was not something I could do comfortably, so hopefully that explains my monstrosity. I have two documents that I edit everyday in Vim, and I will keep using Vim, whether it be from a terminal emulator, Termux, or Linux console.\nI obviously really enjoy his creation, and I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry to have heard of his passing. RIP.\nAugust 17, 2023 Gold Leafed Marmalade I promise to never use AI memes or text for this blog. Bam, done. Pizza time\nMothballed two @csmertx social media accounts recently. The only websites I check anymore are Imgur and Facebook. For the piping hot Star Trek memes of course. And I do my best to avoid the mud thrown in the Red vs. Blue mudslinging match. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot like dodging water balloons on the last day of high school (catapults .. ).\nThe trick is to spot the airborne balloon, and assume it\u0026rsquo;s not full of water..\nAnd I tell you what, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for inexpensive jeans for work that are more durable than certain outdoor brands, look for surplus uniform jeans on Ebay. These sellers inspect, sort, and wash the pants (depending on the seller ofc). Mostly Redkap brand, which are also sold new through Amazon. What makes these jeans better? Industrial grade stitching, extra belt loops, cotton/polyester blend for stretch/cooling, made for strong legs, and have YKK zippers. Some spots included, but who cares? They\u0026rsquo;re work pants.\nAlso, how do people just sit down and have a conversation with a virtual theater of people? Like, they just do that, and it\u0026rsquo;s rad. I envy your ability to sit still long enough to make that happen. With so many words in the US English language, and so many dialects, and it all just rolls off your tongues. It\u0026rsquo;s as easy to you as eating this slice of pizza is to me.\n*unapologetic pineapple chunk noises*\nAugust 20, 2023 Brink! the Disney Channel movie WOOO! YAHOOO!!! YOOOOOOOO!!!! *More RedBull noises*\nZerospin alleyoop soyale. Looking back, it\u0026rsquo;s funny to think how I failed so spectacularly on a suburban flat bar set-up. One of those wiggly Walmart flat bars. Three years before I messed up my ankle, I was zerospining on to to adult picnic tables. If I remember correctly, the trick is a funny way of saying backwards 360. My skates were less like the sleek inline skates designed for cruisin\u0026rsquo; around Venice Beach, and more like a cross between hockey skates and snowboard boots. I mean, there\u0026rsquo;s a reason why skateboarders called us fruitbooters (AKA frootbooters). My skates were: Remz 2004 (beige) with Groundcontrol frames to help keep from smearing wax all over the skatepark (just like the picture above). There\u0026rsquo;s nothing like running up a metal quarter pipe on skates with wax on the wheels. I started with a 1998-2001 model of USD (company) 🔗 Throne (model) I found for $80 at a local sporting goods reseller.\nThe real crime was the ultra tall green Guinness shirt that I wore to cover my sagging bottom. KFC 3 era 🔗 Alex Broskow I was not.\nAt the time I was begrudgingly riding a Manco Hornet scooter to work. Which was about as cool as it sounds. When I called the local motorcycle shop and said, \u0026ldquo;Hi, I have a Manco Scooter..\u0026rdquo; I was cut off with an, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m sorry you\u0026rsquo;re driving that hunk of junk around, but please continue.\nTo be fair, I got my damn headlight bulb lol\nSometimes I wonder what people think of that one employee that\u0026rsquo;s moving around using crutches. I mean, working retail is a physically demanding job. People underestimate the amount of 12pk sodas and gallon water jugs being lugged around by the staff. Gallon jugs of water at the time were delivered in boxes of 6 gallons per box. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve unloaded a trailer full of water you start to see the other deliveries with a different perspective. I was that person using crutches for three weeks. I should have been that person using crutches after a full examination and whatever pins or casts or boots may have been required to fix what I screwed up. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of twisting around in the air and landing in strange foot configurations for the trick I was trying to perfect (rolling as fast as possible). Thankfully, during the Thing whatever was causing the strange shifting sensation in my ankle/heal stopped. Actually, during the Thing was when I started experimenting with high doses of CBD. To each their own.\nTheir own what? Boat? Like, a free boat? Ok.\nAnd to be fair, I saw an MTV action sports segment featuring Josh Petty that really sparked my interest in the sport. There were two songs I remember: 1. Mykill Myers - Who Am I, and 2: 🔗 The Associates - From the Ground Up (The World Famous Beat Junkies - Vol. 2 ft. DJ Rhettmatic). I\u0026rsquo;m nearly certain the Who Am I song was for Petty\u0026rsquo;s part. The other song may have been part of a team promo video I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. MTV was spotlighting a lot of interesting talent just before reality TV took over the network.\nThe insult to injury is knowing I could have stomped around in one of those cool looking medical boots.\n♬ I keep stomping in my medically prescribed boots ♬\nAlso, during 2005 I took a still photograph of my eMachines laptop from when I was watching a rollerblading video (Cirque Duh SOL EH? ? \u0026hellip; or B-Unique\u0026rsquo;s Freestyle rolling? idk). How about the corner apartment room with the dual windows and that awesome storm season breeze? I\u0026rsquo;ll admit it, staying in North Central Florida has a few perks.\nBootlegged Bansky with a Noritsu Noritsu Koki QSS-32_33 lab printer/scanner courtesy of 🔗Minilab.ca\nI dug around the metadata for the labtop image above (shot with a 🔗Canon SLR) and found that I used a 🔗 Noritsu Koki QSS-32_33 lab printer/scanner to print that image. I took several years of typing classes, and the printing controls were limited to a few clusters of buttons, so correcting and printing was one of those weird things that I could do pretty well. Red/Green/Blue adjustments, brightness adjustments, and contrast adjustments. When paired with an appropriate developer (that I have no info on), the lab was capable of printing within 40-45 minutes depending on the number of photos taken per roll. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember all the details, but IIRC, processing the negatives took around 30 minutes. That is, if whomever loaded the machine taped the leader to the leader card correctly. Lost wedding photos once. That was a fun explanation.\n\u0026ldquo;Ma\u0026rsquo;am, our machine, it ate your memories.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yep, chomped them real good.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Oh sure, here\u0026rsquo;s a CVS giftcard for when you want your negatives to get tangled in the gears of this machine again.\u0026rdquo; *Slaps Machine for Good Measure*\nIIRC, the reason store employees told customers 1 hour to develop and print/scan was due to the volume of rolls. On a typical day we printed about 40 rolls, but for certain days of the year we were printing upwards of 120 rolls. I had to tell people coming in with family photos that they\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait until the next day because property damage insurance photos were piling up behind the developer. I stopped counting hours after I told a customer that the wait would be eight hours. Develop, correct, print, and talked photo lab customers through the envelopes. There were also grad night rushes, and graduation rushes.\nAnd yea, I may have learned to print quick because kids visited the store with their folks, and some people thought it was a good idea to drop off their \u0026lsquo;honeymoon\u0026rsquo; pictures. Is honeymoon the right word for it? Thankfully, I\u0026rsquo;ve blocked those particular images from my mind.\nAugust 27, 2023 Nerd cred revoked! Please try again later. Habaneros should be much hotter. There, I said it, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad I said it.\nThe truth is that I am a happier and healthier person while using cannabis. I still have an occasional drink though (a few times a year). And yes, my glass piece did come with a complimentary pair of Birkenstock Sandals, thank you very much for asking. I suddenly feel the urge to rally against 🔗 GMOs for some reason. They\u0026rsquo;re a big factor of corn production in the United States - but still - my Birkenstocks have broken through my blood brain barrier. There\u0026rsquo;s no hope for me now. Save yourself..\nA few months after I quit cannabis, I lost my main project contract due to low productivity. Apparently, my performance was not on par with my peers, so they ended my contract a week after I passed a project instruction comprehension quiz. In my defense, we were doing 5-15 minutes of searching per task within 1-2 minutes. But wow that job kept my mind busy like no other.\nThe occasional flashback. I mean, let\u0026rsquo;s be real here, the work I did was for a project that interfaced directly with an everyday people network that used a very ineffective content filtering algorithm. The filtering improved quite a bit after the first year, but that first year was just wild. I thought a billion-dollar company would have that figured out before I signed up, but initiating my first inappropriate content flag during the first week proved that theory was incorrect. Please don\u0026rsquo;t sue this smol blogger. This is not even an actual blog. I don\u0026rsquo;t even generate .xml for RSS feeds, so no 🔗 Slashdot Effect for me (lol).\nThe non-disclosure agreement I signed forbids me from sharing all the identifying details of the work I did, but I can say I started during a very interesting time in U.S. American history. I learned more about news events during those two years than I had in the previous ten years.\nThe slightly filtered smoke you see trapped in that pipe shown above comes from a hemp plant. I bought another 1/4 pound of dried hemp flower early last month. It\u0026rsquo;s really the only thing legal in the state of Florida that is even remotely close to marijuana. I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned 🔗 Delta-8 before in previous posts. The main chemical of the hybrid/creativity strain I use is 🔗 CBG, which is similar to 🔗 CBD, but different. It\u0026rsquo;s a difference that\u0026rsquo;s difficult to explain. I feel like my dexterity is better with CBG (CBG \u0026amp; 2x Delta-8). Gotta load up on those dexterity points, right?\nKubuntu 23.04 Update: It\u0026rsquo;s still fine. I prefer it over 22.04 for playing Steam games. Still use it on the same system I use for my side hustle. It\u0026rsquo;s fine. Fixing whatever madness breaks out when using KDE settings to save session would be nice polish. In the meantime, I have a 🔗 Plasma restart script, and a 🔗 KDE reboot script. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m doing it wrong, I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nAnd before I get thousands of emails in my inbox (lol), yes, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried CBD gummies before. Gummies are just not for me. The 🔗 gummies container I bought has bright colorful cartoon animals on it - just like candy packaging for kids - what could go wrong, right? Oh no, my anxy uncle vibes are showing huh?\nWhelp, back to getting mildly high and reading Goosebumps books. I have five on the 2read pile, and twenty more in the mail, lol. They\u0026rsquo;re like these little time capsules that can be bought for the price of a Starbucks pumpkin spice cold nitro latte espresso macchiato chai mocha grande.\nTasty microchips That\u0026rsquo;s the antennae needed to track a product inside a retail store.\nI mean, technically speaking, a substance or nanobot assembly squad could replicate an antennae using the blood stream, but even so it would take a strong power source to boost the signal beyond the epidermis. And the blockage caused by the antennae would most likely cause cardiac arrest. So, I guess that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work very well at all.\nAugust 30, 2023 Depression \u0026amp; Loneliness ALL. THE. MONDAYS.\nThe awesome part of owning a brain that loses track of time so often is that I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel depression like other people. I\u0026rsquo;m not even masking, I may feel depressed for maybe a day, and then it just flows out of my brain. When I was 18, and had been out of my folk\u0026rsquo;s house for a few years, depression was a malady that was only for the financially secure. My perspective from that era was formed from friends, conversations on city buses, skating around downtown, newspapers, co-workers, and non-fiction books. People didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to think about depression. I\u0026rsquo;ve been numb to the world for long stretches of time, but I believe that is something entirely different.\nThe heck is Depression? Is that the new pizza place off Slurg St. and Flargatoon Ave.?\nBy 2020 I had spent six years in self-isolation. I\u0026rsquo;ve probably mentioned this in a previous blog post. People were losing their minds after the first month of The Thing. That\u0026rsquo;s when it sort of clicked in my head. Once my anxiety of the neighborhood subsided, I had some thoughts to work through. Trust for me is seeing a neighborhood that is very self-sufficient, and is not likely to resort to fighting over resources. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly sure which neighborhood I was in until 2021. When you\u0026rsquo;re waking up every morning at 5:30am, because it\u0026rsquo;s the typical time for smash and grab home invasions, it\u0026rsquo;s a difficult time to organize thoughts. An attempted murder investigation was conducted in this neighborhood just a few years before The Thing. And a neighbor was arrested for dealing (probably weed). It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to be cautious. Like I said, during 2021 was when I had a moment for introspective. For the first time in years, I could breathe a sigh of relief and know that I was working, and that my brain is just fine.\nThe investigation was over $600 in cash. Seriously.\nCapitulating is not something that comes easy to me. For some it\u0026rsquo;s this grand gesture to continue the game, and for me, it\u0026rsquo;s just tedious and tiresome. To be clear, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about kissing the king\u0026rsquo;s ring and falling into some kind of complicated hierarchy. So yea, obviously when I was younger I had a lot of time-outs, and free time to dedicate towards introspection (reading books was allowed).\nI might kiss a ring for Chicago deep dish with sausage, pepperoni, black olives, and pineapples tho\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to keep the loneliness part of this blog post brief. Yep, I feel it every day. And yea, I would gladly accept help. I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid to admit that I need help. For sure. With that said, I would never want someone to help me in the guise of trying to change me into someone I\u0026rsquo;m not. I am the only me that I will ever be. Also, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that podcasts and reading helps a great deal.\nReading kitschy novels about monsters and wtf \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;GO EAT WORMS!\u0026rdquo; How do I even classify that genre?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something to be said about going to church to help with loneliness. I was raised with Lutheran values, but never attended a sermon as a kid. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve read somewhere that church folks actually live longer because of the unity of the congregations. No doubt there are several hundred studies on the subject. As long as the churches honor human dignity and soulful values, I see no harm in believing in a higher power. When I was working during The Thing, I came across several security cam videos showing difficult to explain supernatural like events. Mists floating through doors, etc. Maybe?\nEvents strong enough to trigger motion detection flood lights\u0026hellip;\nI lean towards a belief that the afterlife is more of an energy transfer. We all hit the ground running in an attempt to assemble ourselves again. Which I realize is sobering and terrifying, but far better than believing that it all just ends. I think there are some layers that scientists may not have observed just yet - is all I\u0026rsquo;m saying.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey boss, can you spare some of your energy essence? I promise I\u0026rsquo;ll give it back\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAnd in the life goal category: 31 Goosebumps books acquired, and 31 more to go.

A lot of the book is verbatim dictation from the clients of Edward M. Hallowell, M.D., and John J. Ratey, M.D., which is pretty awesome. From what I understand so far, an ADD diagnosis is a family affair, so it was refreshing to read of behaviors that are identical to my own memories of childhood. And with so many fresh perspectives, \u0026ldquo;Driven To Distraction\u0026rdquo; is almost too refreshing for my brain to handle. What\u0026rsquo;s worse is that I bought three more books about ADD (same two authors). Oh no, look at me, I have too many books to read *Giant Man Baby Noises*\nMy father passed away in 2012, so there\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no way to talk to him about my childhood. In the book \u0026ldquo;Driven To Distraction\u0026rdquo;, fathers of both children and adults diagnosed with ADD were surprised to know that their child actually answered truthfully when they repeated the sentence, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; I felt terrible after all my mischievous moments as a kid, but when I was asked why I did it (whatever it was), I \u0026lsquo;didn\u0026rsquo;t have an answer\u0026rsquo; or an excuse. I never blamed the family doggo or a friend. My answer was either a resigned, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;, or an exasperated, \u0026ldquo;I DON\u0026rsquo;T KNOW!\u0026rdquo; Which was often chased with, \u0026ldquo;You never know do you?\u0026rdquo; Fun times right?\nObviously, there are other symptoms and or behaviors that I would not have associated with ADD that are mentioned in the book. I never considered that certain verbal and written miscommunications could be a symptom of ADD, but I guess that makes sense. When I was younger, it was nearly impossible for me to keep up with taking notes for any of my classes. I\u0026rsquo;d fish out my three holed paper, and start the outlining process as our teacher reached the third bullet point of the topic. By that point, what the teacher said was lost to me as I tried to copy what was already written. Which may resonate with most, but toss in the little detail that I made one to five mistakes per line\u0026ndash;well, I think it\u0026rsquo;s clear why I had a lot of partially completed notes for study time. During my senior year, I was burning through so many mechanical pencil erasers that I had one of those sliding erasers. In community college I remedied this note taking problem by using some of my federal loan money for an RCA Voice Recorder (🔗RP-5010). Finished my first semester with a 3.0 GPA because I would review those recordings after every lecture, I took notes, and I studied those notes. I had 14 credit hours, so I dedicated 28 hours of study time per week. I never finished my A.S. degree for a few different economic reasons which include receiving my loan and small grant three weeks after the semester began. I fear ridicule, and I\u0026rsquo;ve grappled with forming English sentences since I was in high school, so why not create a candid blog? That sounds like a sensible thing to do with my free time.\nActually, speaking of my inability to find the right words and stuff\u0026ndash;at this particular phase of my life, my friendships have regrettably transitioned from friendships to acquaintances. One of the many pitfalls of having ADD is incidentally and or accidentally burning preverbal bridges. I\u0026rsquo;m also 38, and consistently feel like I\u0026rsquo;m 10-20 years behind, so my friendship status is not just because of ADD. There are some natural processes at play too. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m an outlier and most with ADD can maintain friendships, but people with ADD seem to step on their own toes a lot. I have also lost at least one job because I forgot which day I was suppose to work. And for at least two jobs, I simply decided not to go anymore. Which I know is incredibly irresponsible, but at the time I thought I was making the best decision of my life. Even if the jobs I had were \u0026lsquo;just hourly retail jobs\u0026rsquo;, at least I had the means to maintain my independence. The consequence of one of those \u0026lsquo;career\u0026rsquo; decisions resulted in me paying half the rent of a room in an apartment in North Central Florida, while I payed half the rent of a two bedroom apartment in South Florida. I made that \u0026lsquo;career\u0026rsquo; decision the moment I turned off my alarm clock. After the alarm clock was vanquished, I stayed in bed for the entire day, \u0026ldquo;Nope, I\u0026rsquo;m not going in anymore.\u0026rdquo; The panic most people would feel was completely absent from my brain. For a few months after the decision, I felt like I was alive again, and that my possibilities were endless. That feeling changed when I realized that I was out of instant ramen noodles (Top Ramen). While employed, my savings went towards little nuggets of irony, like Payday candy bars, so instant ramen noodles were less of an adapted lifestyle and more of a life necessity. My calves are probably more toned because all of all the 🔗 muscle spasms I use to experience when I tried to sleep (not enough minerals, calcium, and potassium).\nIn order to offset many of the pitfalls of ADD (unconfirmed), I have logs of everything. When I say everything, I mean, I have a log of my meals that I started in 2017. I could pull up what I ate for lunch on October 13, 2020 (Maruchan without eggs, seitan, or pork loin). I also created a system log/life journal in 2017. I also need some real world tangible control of my schedule, so to the left of this desk is a 38x26in world map, and above that is a 23x17in monthly calendar dry erase board. Before I clean the dry erase board for the next month, I take a photo (snapshot) of the previous month. After the Nextcloud app on my phone syncs photos and videos to my local cloud, I move the image of previous month to a specific folder for future reference. I also have an offline digital calendar (🔗 Calcurse) to record completed daily tasks. And I\u0026rsquo;m not kidding, one of those tasks is to remind myself to shower (everyday).\nThe digital calendar I mentioned in the last paragraph (🔗 Calcurse) shares a 🔗 TMUX session with the system log/journal, calorie log, and a few other things. The digital calendar is called Calcurse because it\u0026rsquo;s a calendar that uses the curses TUI framework. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s a calendar accessible from the command line, so it\u0026rsquo;s very portable. I launch the TMUX session by typing the word \u0026lsquo;daily\u0026rsquo; (with help from: 🔗 tmuxinator) and then I press enter on the keyboard. Since it\u0026rsquo;s a TMUX session, I can access the session through SSH as long as I have access to the home WiFi. I feel that having an easy way to set timers (or reminders) has also helped me in the past. At the moment I use a Fossil Hybrid smartwatch to bark out commands to Alexa®, \u0026ldquo;set a timer for 5 minutes please\u0026rdquo;, but before that I used my bash script 🔗 Ghemx to help me with setting reminders/timers. My Ghemx config file still has timers saved for the washer and dryer. Actually, two timers for the washer (I dump the detergent in after the machine fills with water), and one for the dryer. If KDE Connect is configured to send desktop notifications out to an Android device, Ghemx uses notify-send, so those notifications will pass through as well. With KDE Connect notifications enabled via whatever smartwatch app (i.e. Fossil app), it should also push out notifications from Ghemx on to smartwatch screens. Ghemx has pushed notifications out to my PineTime smartwatch and my Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid smartwatch. Now I\u0026rsquo;ll be the first to admit, my Bash language skills are unorthodox, and Ghemx should have been written in Python. Visualizing object oriented languages is not a skill I have access to on command. For example, this very simple password generator Python script that I call 🔗 passgen took me about 40 hours to write, comment, and debug. Someone well versed in Python could have written a similar script in less than an hour.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot to process recently to say the least. Finding out that I\u0026rsquo;m not actually a terrible person was pretty good news. Also finding out that most of my impulsive decisions have been due to a misunderstanding of how my brain works was comforting as well.\nThanks goes out to the gods and goddesses of technology. Because I would be lost without it (literally lol).\nJuly 26, 2023 Pseudo-ADD Kelly casted confusion\nI love low powered bluetooth radios as much as the next person, but seriously, Fossil could have developed a wonderful watch with an estimated seven day battery life and it would have been so much better. Most of my problems with the FTW 7074 come from bluetooth interference within a few feet away from the phone.\nWith that said, The Fossil Hybrid watch has indirectly helped with voice activated timers. Small productivity boosters to help with daily side hustle tasks. And the rain percentage provided from voice commands appears to be somewhat accurate. I think it\u0026rsquo;s kind of funny that I can\u0026rsquo;t effectively ask for the current illumination or phase of the moon from the watch. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s effectively a water dog watch, so why not have all water dog things like wave height and moon phases? Though now that I think about it, reef surfers would probably break the \u0026lsquo;mineral\u0026rsquo; glass (not sapphire) within a few weeks.\nSince this is a mostly Linux website, KDE Connect does show up in the toggle-able apps to push notifications to the watch, but I\u0026rsquo;ve had to toggle it off for KDE Connect. It was a great for a week when KDE Connect ignored desktop computer 🔗 MPRIS events. Now with notifications toggled on, KDE Connect will push notifications to my watch regarding each and every YouTube video I watch, or each song that plays from my desktop computer. Which is odd, because I do not receive these notifications on my phone, just my watch.\nCreated: 07/13/2023 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":45,"href":"/Linux/Devices/touchpad_config/","title":"💻 Touchpads","parent":"💻 Devices","content":"\rJelly Comb glass slow cursor w/Ubuntu 22.04 Rendered my touchpad unusable for a few weeks\nlibinput list-devices\nHTX USB HID Device HTX HID Device Mouse Upgraded to Ubuntu (Kubuntu) 23.04\nTracking as expected after upgrading to 22.10, then 23.04 Laptop vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-libinput.conf\nSection \u0026#34;InputClass\u0026#34;\rIdentifier \u0026#34;touchpad catchall\u0026#34;\rDriver \u0026#34;synaptics\u0026#34;\rMatchIsTouchpad \u0026#34;on\u0026#34;\rMatchDevicePath \u0026#34;/dev/input/event*\u0026#34;\rOption \u0026#34;TapButton1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;\rOption \u0026#34;TapButton2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;3\u0026#34;\rOption \u0026#34;TapButton3\u0026#34; \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;\rOption \u0026#34;HorizTwoFingerScroll\u0026#34; \u0026#34;on\u0026#34; # set to off if edge\rOption \u0026#34;VertTwoFingerScroll\u0026#34; \u0026#34;on\u0026#34; # set to off if edge\rOption \u0026#34;HorizEdgeScroll\u0026#34; \u0026#34;on\u0026#34;\rOption \u0026#34;VertEdgeScroll\u0026#34; \u0026#34;on\u0026#34;\rEndSection Gestures For touchpad/touchpads with multi-touch capabilities\nRequires: wmctrl and xdotool\nDebian/Ubuntu: libinput-tools + wmctrl + xdotool\nsudo gpasswd -a $USER input\ngit clone https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures\ncd libinput-gestures\nsudo make install\ncp /etc/libinput-gestures.conf ~/.config/libinput-gestures.conf\nlibinput-gestures-setup autostart\nlibinput-gestures-setup start\nAfter edits to libinput-gestures.conf run libinput-gestures-setup [stop/start]\nExample config edits\nConfirmed with Jelly Comb USB Touchpad)\n###############################################################################\r# SWIPE GESTURES:\r###############################################################################\r# Note the default is an \u0026#34;internal\u0026#34; command that uses wmctrl to switch\r# workspaces and, unlike xdotool, works on both Xorg and Wayland (via\r# XWayland).

You see, there was a Vim markdown document preview issue that inspired me to try VSCode #nerdtree4life. Anyway, till next time\nVisual Studio Code(receipts):\nChallenger Deep Theme, Code Spell Checker, Dracula Official Theme (current), GitHub Markdown Preview, Markdown Checkboxes, Markdown Emoji, Markdown Footnotes, Markdown Preview GitHub Styling, Markdown Preview Mermaid Support, Markdown yaml Preamble, Remote - SSH, Remote - SSH: Editing Configuration Files, Remote Explorer, Vim (vscodevim), GitLens I probably have just as many Vim plugins installed tbh 🖥️ 💻 🖲️ 📜 🧲 🧰 🔗 🪜 🗝️\nJune 30, 2023 Kubuntu 23.04 Pupgrade No memes, only Kubuntu 23.04\nKubuntu 23.04 seems alright so far. Most of the applications I use are either from Snapcraft or Flathub, so I haven\u0026rsquo;t run into any of those odd issues that sometimes happen with mismatched dependencies. On the plus side, I can now use my Jelly Comb glass touchpad again and one of the Windows games I play doesn\u0026rsquo;t crash when I tab out of it. Yep.\nFossil Neutra Gen. 6 Hybrid Smartwatch (FTW7074) *Presses Alexa button* \u0026ldquo;What is Linux?\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the glass of this watch will survive the battery (7000 series glass appears to be 🔗 Mineral Crystal), but at 14 days per charge I was willing to take that risk. I\u0026rsquo;ve accidentally smacked the watch face against brass door lock strike plates several times and it only has a few scratches. Weak vibe motor though\u0026ndash;I would not recommend this watch for heavy sleepers.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve noticed a few missed opportunities though like battery % via voice command and the blood oxygen sensor seems to be hit or miss. And I haven\u0026rsquo;t researched which weather service backend is used by Alexa (or this version of Alexa). The rain percentage app of the watch consistently under estimates by ~40-50%, and does not understand how to process commands like \u0026ldquo;What is the surf report for St. Augustine?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;What is the wave height for St. Augustine?\u0026rdquo; It may have been a better experience to pair with the Alexa app instead of the Fossil App. It would have been cool to test out some of those neat Alexa skills.\nAs far as receiving notifications from certain apps this Gen. 6 Hybrid seems to perform admirably. Receiving little vibes on my wrist from AutoZen kept my focus on the route a bit more than without. I just wish I could figure out how to switch off MPRIS notifications sent through KDE Connect. Every time I start a video or change songs KDE Connect pushes a notification, and my watch relays that information as a notification. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have this issue with my Pinetime watch running InfiniTime. If I play three albums of songs, I will receive three albums worth of notifications (not including resuming from pause notifications). Also, the watch is not running WearOS, so it\u0026rsquo;s not compatible with Google Play apps built for WearOS. I can see myself checking out the WearOS ecosystem in the future. Lots of interesting apps that would probably be incredible for outdoor adventuring.\nWith all that said it\u0026rsquo;s still a beautiful watch. The estimated 14 day battery life is pretty accurate (e-ink display), and there\u0026rsquo;s no touchscreen to phantom press when it rains or while swimming. And finally I think the Alexa integration is relatively impressive when I take into consideration that I feel like Harold Crick from the movie Stranger Than Fiction while I\u0026rsquo;m wearing the watch.\nCreated: 06/04/2023 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":48,"href":"/Blog/music/2023/0623/","title":"🎸 06-23","parent":"🎸 2023","content":" June 1, 2023 Blind Guardian - The Throne (Beyond the Red Mirror) June 3, 2023 Blind Guardian - Distant Memories (Beyond the Red Mirror) June 9, 2023 Blind Guardian - Sacred Worlds (At the Edge of Time) June 11, 2023 Purity Ring - Obedear (Shrines) June 13, 2023 Talking Heads - Road to Nowhere (Official Video) (Little Creatures) June 25, 2023 Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) - Mr. Blue Sky (Official Video) (All Over The World) June 1, 2023 Blind Guardian - The Throne (Beyond the Red Mirror) 🔗 Blind Guardian - The Throne (Beyond the Red Mirror)\n*ROCK OPERA INTENSIFIES*\nJune 3, 2023 Blind Guardian - Distant Memories (Beyond the Red Mirror) 🔗 Blind Guardian - Distant Memories (Beyond the Red Mirror)\nThat feeling when you adjust the lumbar support just right *CHEF\u0026rsquo;S KISS*\nJune 9, 2023 Blind Guardian - Sacred Worlds (At the Edge of Time) 🔗 Blind Guardian - Sacred Worlds (At the Edge of Time)\nGreat great grandfather Herman S. was a locksmith (born: Prussia, 1858\u0026ndash;emigrated in 1881 via the 🔗 Koln (I) steerage)\nThe 🔗 Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping company was established in 1857, and saw extensive growth under the German Empire\nU.S. America seized 🔗 Koln (II) in 1899 (by Prussian Emigrates?)\n🔗 Koln (III) became a cargo vessel in 1934, and wrecked off the Swedish coast the year of 1940\nSide Note: it\u0026rsquo;s 🔗 said that previous German Empire citizens brought protesting with them to U.S. America.

All the hype about the new Soup-r Mare-e-o brothers movie reminded me of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! (1989), and the Super Mario Bros. movie (1993). That cartoon and that movie were both cucumbers. Not as bad as those really awful videos of people scaring their cats with zucchinis and cucumbers, but dang. The cartoon Genie of the Lamp wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even grant a plumber a wish without some coin. And what was going on with those power boots from the movie? The Goombas? The fungus amongus? Sheesh.\nWhen my folks first moved to Florida my Mom worked at a local pizza parlor (it was the 80s..), and the daycare center I stayed at was actually just the kids play place at the restaurant. The owners wanted the restaurant to be ultra kid friendly, so there was a kids area to watch cartoons and play with toys. I think there was a small arcade too? My introduction to pizza in the states was pretty tasty.\nI may have some work lined up. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even need the fancy webcam and my overpriced shirt and tie (glad I have them tho). Hopefully some new projects will be in the works soon-ish rather than later-ish. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel or act like myself when I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m not doing my share of the work. It\u0026rsquo;s a weird catch 22 during interviews.\nA guy that once rode his bike 10 miles to work in the Florida heat due to the city buses being unreliable can\u0026rsquo;t get a job he\u0026rsquo;s totally qualified for, because he\u0026rsquo;s ashamed of himself, and that shame shows during his interviews. Whether or not the interviewee reads the mood as shame or not doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. The appearance of shame is the appearance of failure. Or in practical terms: two weeks of training waisted. Why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t they hire a college student? I mean, this gray haired guy doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have community service on his resume. And wow, the places on his resume don\u0026rsquo;t even exist anymore. What\u0026rsquo;s that about? And no references?! Yikes.\nthanks for reading\nApril 10, 2023 Super Mario Bros. (1993) Totally tonal Toad again (Super Mario Bros. 1993)\nYou know, Maddy Myers has a point. I recently read their Polygon article titled: 1993’s Super Mario Bros. is so much better than the new animated movie. While I don\u0026rsquo;t have fond memories of this movie from childhood (I have no idea why I missed it tbh), I see what they mean about making an attempt to create a movie that sparks the imagination. The slimy fungus shown on the sets were humanoid mushrooms that were \u0026lsquo;de-evolved\u0026rsquo; using the equipment funded by King Koopa. And there were several nods to Mario Bros. lore that I must have missed.\nCucumber is not the word I should have used. I grew up watching 60s-90s creature features, including the original run of Godzilla movies. And I really liked the The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! and the Super Mario Bros. movie. They\u0026rsquo;re not cucumbers.\nMaybe the movie left me a little bitter because of what they did to Toad. At least they gave him a harmonica, and some spikes on his peacoat. Not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll ever see the new Super Mario Brothers movie, but I do have a new DVD copy of Super Mario Bros. that I purchased from the Amazon, you know.. for science.\nApril 13, 2023 Long term sobriety Dwight Schrute: 🔗 The Office - S02E22 - Casino Night | 00:09:18\nProbably about time for me to stop typing in this blog for a little while (hours of editing later). At the time of writing this I\u0026rsquo;m close to the six month mark without cannabis, and I\u0026rsquo;m at the two year mark of only drinking a few times a year. Right now I wish I could take a walk to clear my head, but a walk would just remind me of all the walking to work I did so many years ago. Memories of mopping up my own soggy tracks from in between the aisles of the retail pharmacy. Besides, in this neighborhood there\u0026rsquo;s a chance that a middle aged man wobbling on an electric scooter will whizz by and honk at me before I reach the mailbox\u0026ndash;though now that I think about it, that does sound somewhat entertaining. Also, in case it wasn\u0026rsquo;t annoyingly obvious, I am an introverted white man in my late thirties, so I pull more aggro than most other people in this neighborhood. I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s clear now why a walk would likely compound my issues into a more tightly wound ball of issues.\nPulling aggro is a reference to heavily armored characters in RPG games that attract the boss monster\u0026rsquo;s attention\nAt the moment it\u0026rsquo;s impossible for me to find joy in filming/producing a video or posting a goofy faced photo of myself to social media. I know the extent of my \u0026lsquo;social influence\u0026rsquo;, and I know myself, which is to say that it\u0026rsquo;s not likely to happen anytime soon without the very chemical substances that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to avoid. That and I\u0026rsquo;m worried about more than just myself. When I worked the retail side of a small pharmacy, I dreaded being stuck behind a register. Restacking a few hundred 12 packs of soda was a treat for me, because it kept me away from the registers. I bet no one could figure out why I wanted to reorganize shelves in the backroom. Climb the 8ft ladder to grab something from loft storage? Yep, on it.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s clear that I\u0026rsquo;m a behind the scenes type of person. This is something I learned about myself right after grade school.\nAs a person that has gone through a metaphorical tunnel filled with people that behave like vampires and zombies, it\u0026rsquo;s a real blow to my morale when I have seen the light at the end of the tunnel, and people have the mental wherewithal to say that the light is actually a train hurtling towards me. I see the utility of this train of thought (snort), but damn. I mean\u0026ndash;I had to wear vampire and zombie costumes to blend in well enough to reach the areas to climb high enough to see the light in the first place. I think the assumption is that this is a typical train tunnel, with trains chugging along on time hauling cargo and or people. The only train I\u0026rsquo;ve rode in Florida reminds me of the very nice train from the movie/book Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. In this particular metaphorical tunnel, the engineers have retired, the trains have been decommissioned and sent to museums or moved to another state. There\u0026rsquo;s also mounds of debris that one has to climb. And believe me, if a train was coming towards me, I\u0026rsquo;d have my worm hooks ready for me to hitch a ride out (partially joking).\nThe part about the train tunnel written above was inspired by the book \u0026ldquo;An Unquiet Mind\u0026rdquo;, by Kay Redfield Jamison (great book!)\nNext up from the shelf is: \u0026ldquo;Ten Things I Hate About Me\u0026rdquo;, by Joe Tracini.\nWhat triggered this blog post is that I recently became aware that Dad was once a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He may have mentioned it during a late night ramble\u0026ndash;obviously I ramble too\u0026ndash;I can\u0026rsquo;t recall. To be honest, Dad rarely talked about his physical ailments. So, as I was holding the medallions in my hand (oh, I probably should have mentioned that this is how I found out), I realized that right now I am older than he was when he became a member of AA. He had fused vertebrae that the military decided was not caused by his 20+ years of service working in the various Navy galleys of various large ships traversing the variously large oceans. Did I mention that back problems run in the family? Probably from a hereditary reluctance to \u0026rsquo;take it easy\u0026rsquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve had my fair share of back sprains, but I never needed the aid of alcohol or weed to ease the pain. So my reasons for consuming were more of a combination of pride, stress testing my brain, and mental relief. For those that need cannabis for pain relief you have my sympathy. I have been a strong supporter of legalization since it was first available as a prescription in the states.\nAs a kid I did not attend any military balls. Dad may have catered those events though.\nWhen I smoked cannabis, my mind could wander freely without being vigilantly alert of my surroundings. It was as if some trait from a bygone era that kept me mentally prepared for a rogue cave bear to crash through a window was subdued. After a smoking \u0026lsquo;session\u0026rsquo; of .25g vaporized cannabis, I could move and edit 3D objects in my mind much like I could with 3D software. Visualizing basic stress testing and simulations of those newly mentally constructed objects (mostly simple designs and simulations) was something I could do as well. I have a very untrained visually motivated mind, and visualizing these things while I\u0026rsquo;m sober is completely within the realm of possibility, but the mental images are not as vivid, and it\u0026rsquo;s not something I can do consistently. Another thing of note was a major boost to my self awareness after trying Delta-9 (THC) on my own. For the first time I was able to accurately process how I project my self image, which was eye opening, and was also the source of many headaches. Smoking cannabis is definitely not something I recommend for those with developing brains. I avoided the first opportunity to smoke a joint at the age of 12, and I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that I had the street smarts to pull that off without drawing too much attention to myself. Appealing to the \u0026ldquo;Oh ok, more for me\u0026rdquo; mentality really smooths things over within small concentrated groups.\nBears, beets, Battlestar Galactica.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve found that keeps me from splurging on a janky CBD blunt is using that money to buy a book, Blu-ray, DVD or CD. I also think about how much I coughed after smoking CBD extracts (even when vaporized\u0026ndash;Delta-9 is not legal in my state..). It helps if the media purchased triggers older memories. Like some kind of double purpose reason to spend a little money on entertainment, and possibly reconnect some neural pathways in the process. Nostalgia I suppose is natural for most people in their thirties anyway. My reasoning behind buying tangible media is that I might not remember the triggering moment or the connection of that moment paired to a certain movie (like a Blu-ray copy of Ghostbusters: Afterlife), but I can look at a shelf and see my sobriety represented as a media collection. Which might seem dorky, but I\u0026rsquo;m ok with that.\nDouble Purpose Reason is either a totally for real new dance move or a totally for real new band name.\nWhile these purchases may seem like a redirect of impulse buys (at the moment my underpants are held together by safety pins), if I keep my media purchases inline with only my strongest desires to buy a blunt, or a 48pk (or a handle of something\u0026ndash;I was raised German American), I can avoid going over my entertainment budget. Which I realize for some may be easier said than done. I guess my tolerance never went beyond 1g a day. For that and too many other reasons to list, I am very fortunate. The isometric layout of the situation should make it clear that I\u0026rsquo;m also investing in something for the future. Sure they\u0026rsquo;re just micro investments, but they add up to a tremendous entertainment value.\nIsometric layout is a reference to isometric style video games like Bastion, Path of Exile, and Diablo.\nNext to me is a workstation computer with the added benefit of streaming media rips on the local network (via 🔗 Jellyfin). That\u0026rsquo;s another factor in my preference for physical media. As soon as it\u0026rsquo;s out of the shipping packaging, I clean the media if it\u0026rsquo;s used, then I rip it to the server. No ads, no subscription costs, and the software never forgets where I left off, because that\u0026rsquo;s a feature of Jellyfin. As a testament of my tendency to be overly prepared for things, the server runs off a very large uninterruptible power supply (~45 minutes of battery life), so temporary power outages are not a problem. I\u0026rsquo;m stoked to have nearly completed the collection of Star Wars Blu-rays. Next up is completing the Studio Ghibli, and Pixar Blu-ray collections (just a few left to collect).\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s wise to look back just to see how far you\u0026rsquo;ve traveled. Plus, gotta catch them all right?\nSince my drug of choice was cannabis, the trade offs were rather low (!\u0026ndash;the trade offs are exponentially worse for adolescents\u0026ndash;!), but the trade offs for adults have a tendency to compound over time. The more memories I developed under the influence, the fewer I could recall while sober. I have a difficult time believing that cannabis is a legitimate cause of memory loss for adults (brain damage). Well, I mean, unless a person is smoking 3g or more a day. At that level of cannabis consumption, the amount of carcinogens being inhaled from the combustion of plant material might be something to consider as well. While I\u0026rsquo;m on the subject of smoking methods, bongs don\u0026rsquo;t filter out the harmful chemicals 🔗 Healthline.com | Demystifying the Bong), so ah\u0026ndash;well they look pretty anyway. I think something random like working as an A/C mechanic in Florida attics in the summer is more likely to cause memory loss. From my own personal experience, it was difficult for me to retrieve a memory when it was formed while in an altered mental state, unless I was in the same altered mental state while attempting to access that memory. I like to think that my memories were simply misplaced. Like a media remote that for one reason or another moves itself to odd places in the living room (like behind the couch).\nThis metaphorical remote is also my phone, which makes misplacing it even more daunting.\nFor the reasons listed above, and potentially needing to drive somewhere at any moment for any purpose are the reasons why I decided it was time to quit. Not to mention, smoking cannabis for escapism instead of pain relief, or drinking every night, is kind of like putting money in a pile and setting the money on fire. Instead of burning my pile of money, I now have to figure out what shelving to build for all this media that is sure to never go out of style. I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to find an excuss to try out Japanese pull saws, and well cared for shelving would be excuse number two.\nArticles on long term use of cannabis: 🔗 CDC, 🔗 NIH, 🔗 Heathline.com, 🔗 CNN\nCreated: 04/08/2023 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":54,"href":"/Linux/Software/docker/","title":"💻 Docker","parent":"💻 Software","content":" See also Jellyfin\nInstallation docker\nsudo systemctl {start,enable} docker.service\nList Containers docker images\nsudo docker ps\nLogs sudo docker logs containerid Storage Driver sudov /etc/docker/daemon.json\n++ { ++ \u0026#34;storage-driver\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;overlay2\u0026#34; ++ } Volume examples docker run -d \\\n--volume /dir/media:/media\nPermissions sudo usermod -aG docker user Cannot connect to docker daemon error sudo snap start docker\nsudo systemctl status docker\nsudo systemctl enable docker\nsudo systemctl start docker\nPurge all the things sudo docker system prune Docker Compose Visit: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/\nLinux \u0026gt; Install Compose on Linux Systems\nsudoc /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\nmkdir ~/.sources/project-name\ncd ~/.sources/project-name\nmv docker-compose.yml ~/.sources/project-name/docker-compose.yml\ndocker-compose up\nRemove Container docker stop [container_id]\nor [container_name]\ndocker rm [container_id]\nor [container_name]\nResources Docker / Docs / Overview Created: 12/29/2021 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":55,"href":"/Linux/Software/jellyfin/","title":"💻 Jellyfin (Media Server)","parent":"💻 Software","content":" Install Docker apti snapd\nsudo snap install docker\nYep, container in a container.

Thankfully I\u0026rsquo;ll never have to go through that again. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s time to learn how to tie a tie.\nMarch 14, 2023 オラ! オラ! Kev has Jim\u0026rsquo;s back yo\nI posted a song by Ratatat called Seventeen Years in 🔗 Music Blog for March 2023. I feel like I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to say this, because I\u0026rsquo;ve been an adult since 2003, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t write the song Seventeen Years. The music was created by Ratatat (lyrics by Young Churf). The video was created by a bunch of talented artists. The premise of the video is about rainforest deforestation, habitation destruction, and the effects it has on the planet. Raccoons seem to be globally recognized creatures, so it makes sense they were used in the video instead of Toucan Sam or King Kong.\nI guess I have another story to tell after all. When I was ten I helped Dad build a fenced in area for a garden. Which sounds normal right? Wild animals eat unprotected produce all the time. So, I chopped down all the small crab apple trees required (by myself) with a normal sized axe, cut the trees to length, and then we assembled the fence. I wanted to cut down more trees, because that\u0026rsquo;s fun right? No access to 90s cable TV type boredom. I guess I was posturing during a conversation, so Dad bet me that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t cut down a medium sized oak tree that was way to close to the house. Just a prideful bet.\n11/23/2024 - Chopping proof. Wrong axe. Soaked wood. Smol sentences.\nNaturally, I woke up early the next morning and spent six hours chopping into that oak tree. Did I mention it was close to the house? What happened next was like a scene out of that show the Beverly Hillbillies. The tree nearly took out the bay window on the side of our double wide mobile home. We lived within biking distance of a pond, and Dad couldn\u0026rsquo;t drive anymore due to reasons, so that was cool.\nThe town was so tiny that the middle school was also a high school (grades 6-12..). The magnet program for that school was agricultural, which included real life cows. Not at a nearby pasture, there was a literal cow pasture attached to the side of the high school. Like, people showed up to class in literal cowboy boots (lots of rattlesnakes in Hawthorne, FL). Instead of this example of a morning announcement: \u0026ldquo;the owner of the blue Corolla left their lights on\u0026rdquo;, morning announcements where more like: \u0026ldquo;the owner of the blue chevy left a shotgun in their gun rack\u0026rdquo;. I went to both types of schools, and the same inflection was used for either announcement.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s my point? I don\u0026rsquo;t have one. Also, I never developed a fear for dentists. That\u0026rsquo;s not it.\nMarch 24, 2023 Goat on a diving board Those darn kids!\nMagnesia Springs was a strange place in the early 90s..\nI can\u0026rsquo;t see myself shilling out this website on Reddit or Imgur. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure I could pull off a post that ends in positive numbers on those websites. My social media presence as a whole is statuesque at best.\nIf it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for a mixture of insanity and a love for this quirky thing known as Linux, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have themed out this site and wrote all these gosh darn notes.\nWith all that said, not one single click from Google searches. I guess my SEO skills are on par with my social media skills.\nI like to build things, cut wood into smaller pieces, and design trinkets for 3D printing. I recently sketched out an existing porch in Blender 3D. The porch steps need handrails, so ah, that\u0026rsquo;ll be fun.\nMarch 29, 2023 Every of the time Sharks of Scranton, PA\nAbout a week ago I traded my busted Thinkpad for a packet of magic legumes. A few days ago a neck tie and a Logitech Streamcam grew out of those very fine legumes. Now if I could only rock the square toed dress shoe that John Krasinski wears in The Office (S07E19 - Garage Sale). I\u0026rsquo;d be the talk of every virtual meeting. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about me, I won\u0026rsquo;t be handing out all my millions though. I learned as a kid that I should only give my money to those in need (or at least someone I\u0026rsquo;m acquainted with IRL), and I\u0026rsquo;ve stuck to that principle ever since. Also social media comments. Can\u0026rsquo;t be giving away all that comment gold right?\nAnyway, I just recently developed a very serious addiction to Skyrim, so I added a 🔗 note about fixing input lag (keyboard/mouse). Speaking of input lag, there\u0026rsquo;s an Xbox One controller on this desk, but I\u0026rsquo;ll leave the controller input lag testing to the controller experts. I use this controller for sports games like skateboarding, fishing, \u0026amp; racing\u0026ndash;oh and I guess indie games too. I\u0026rsquo;ll also leave the game play and walkthrough details to the very kind and very capable PC/console game Tubers.\nOh, and one more thing. I guess I should include the porch sketch I made via CGI software with a namesake of a certain kitchen appliance. Toaster 3D. The sketch was made just to illustrate what was in my head. Let\u0026rsquo;s call it a project approval sketch (not my porch). I had to relearn the software, so it took about five hours. I\u0026rsquo;m new to pocket holes, Japanese pull saws, and Japanese wood rasps, so this\u0026rsquo;ll be interesting. I won\u0026rsquo;t be posting photos due to privacy concerns. And if the steps have any lateral wiggle, I\u0026rsquo;ll ask a neighbor for a cup of hammer drill and Tapcons to help screw it down. That\u0026rsquo;s what people do right? They ask neighbors for random stuff? When I built the steps I placed pavers under the steps to prevent any Z axis slippage. So if needed I can anchor the steps to the concrete pavers.\nI use to use Tapcon anchors to secure residential A/C condensers to precast concrete pads when I was an HVAC mechanic. And I built a lot of aluminum boxes. Lots of box making in that job. Good god, those tin snipes they showed in The Office (S08E09 - Mrs. California) would have been extremely helpful. Precast leveling, copper brazing, wading through fiberglass, strapping, flex ducts, building fiberglass boxes, building PVC drain pipes, and trying not to catch the customer(s) on fire with the oxyacetylene torch.

I think I may have 75% of the pages edited and ready to be pushed upstream. I feel like if I don\u0026rsquo;t at least shout into the void, I may go crazy. So if there\u0026rsquo;s ever a wonder as to why I created a blog for a website of little consequence\u0026ndash;well\u0026ndash;there it is.\nFebruary 5, 2023 Blog posts within resolve #2 \u0026ldquo;What good is a phone call, if you are unable to speak?\u0026rdquo;\nI know, creating an issue within my own project and merging my own fix is against the natural order of open source. I\u0026rsquo;m surprised it\u0026rsquo;s even allowed by Microsoft.. err.. Github. Right, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how many pages I have left to edit. I\u0026rsquo;ll dedicate a full day to go over as much as I can, add some links and whatnot, but I can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee that all the niche notes will be current. I have SOME spare time, but not enough to check every command and reinstall every operating system. I mean, by my various gods, attempting to install all the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) systems again would take up an entire 40 hour work week. As would a single Arch Linux, or Slackware system.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, that gif above reminds me of how I feel about dating. Back when The Office (US) first aired, I was in a long distance online relationship. Which is probably way more popular in 2023. It only lasted a year, because I was way too immature for her. Webcams, microphones, text messaging, eating instant ramen to save for flights to Toronto. I learned that I really like snow. I also saw how my hair is suppose to look for the first time. Hard water sure is a thing here in Florida. A lot of firsts happened like riding in a subway car. Ok, time for more page edits. This markup won\u0026rsquo;t format itself.\nFebruary 8. 2023 Open hwhat now? \u0026ldquo;So uh, are you gonna be using this bumper? Ok then, stay safe out there. Bye now.\u0026rdquo;\nGoing over all the pages again to make sure formatting is as unified as possible. I hope all the website clonings are from bots scanning repositories for sensitive data. Because damn, I put a lot of myself in to this website, it would take a lot to take it all out just for copy pasta. Anyway, off I go again\u0026ndash;sweepin\u0026rsquo; up tea leaves\u0026ndash;making sure the website is as presentable as possible.\nFebruary 11, 2023 The meme-est 🔗 University of Colorado Boulder: Shining a light on what comes up when you flush\nMore neat stuff added to 🔗 FFmpeg. The meme wheel keeps turning. Hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ve finished all the housekeeping needed to keep this website floating for a little while longer. It\u0026rsquo;s not the sparkliest of metaphorical boats, but it\u0026rsquo;ll do just fine for now. And about VSCode\u0026ndash;I get it now. A 32in 4K monitor and VSCode with Dracula theme really hits my visual sweet spot.\nFebruary 12, 2023 Now what? Sneak attack 101\nIf I don\u0026rsquo;t install each pending Flatpak update I see in KDE Discover independently, the updates will stall indefinitely. Apps installed as Snaps seem to update automatically, and in my experience, Snaps don\u0026rsquo;t integrate well with notifications. Which is fine for others, but for me there are times when a notification equals a limited time opportunity to earn some money. Also, for some reason I have to RMB and Copy Link Location to visit links from emails viewed with Thunderbird. If I don\u0026rsquo;t copy the link Thunderbird, will open a blank tab in a new Firefox window. It\u0026rsquo;s just.. what happened? I\u0026rsquo;m thinking I may try Debian KDE with backports and some manually compiled software. Wait, did I just describe Linux Mint? Sheesh.\nThe Arch Linux route.. well, there\u0026rsquo;s a reason why I added the 🔗 Arch Linux restore page to this website. Actually, Arch Linux is the reason I created the page for 🔗 BorgBackup, and this 🔗 backup script Instead of another two year Arch Linux adventure, I\u0026rsquo;d rather go camping, hiking, or step on a skateboard. Sheesh.\nBut seriously, at least on the Linux side I\u0026rsquo;m not pausing updates for weeks at a time just to avoid the Windows 11 update process.\nFebruary 13, 2023 Aliems Hexagonal aliems\nFlipped a vintage keyboard recently. Such a weird commodity. These days a tricked out keyboard sells faster than a rare DVD or video game. And early 2020 was definitely the time to buy cheap vintage mechanical keyboards. Anyway, I have a few extra Linux operating systems on the SSD of the computer I\u0026rsquo;m typing this from. I should at least switch one out for Linux Mint.\nBy the way, the notes I take of Linux Mint or Debian, or whatever operating system that comes next won\u0026rsquo;t be cluttered with a bunch of words. I\u0026rsquo;ve saved these Blog. pages to clutter with a bunch of words instead. This should be obvious by now. Why would anyone need to read some long winded obfuscated explanation of 🔗 Ranger File Manager, when a few examples and links will do?\nFebruary 14, 2023 It is Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day. 🔗 Planetes (1999)\nVSCode spell check enabled. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find an extension that rewrites my sentences in to well written sentences, so uh, sorry about that.\nFebruary 19, 2023 Until next time Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen. 2 I was hoping that a new battery, and refreshing the thermal paste/VRAM pads would eventually fix the overheating issue. Now it looks like I\u0026rsquo;ll need to get a new CM246 chipset, and a decent hot air gun specifically for soldering.\nWell, at least I know there is a power issue, and where the excess heat was coming from. So far I\u0026rsquo;ve replaced the CPU/GPU thermal paste with 🔗 Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut paste. When I unplugged/plugged the CMOS battery so that the Thinkpad would roar back to life is when the chipset blew. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it was from cleaning with 🔗 99.9% Isopropyl alcohol. And the thermal paste I used is non-conductive.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll get some testing equipment to check all the 🔗 mosfets. Someone from Lenovo\u0026rsquo;s refurb division (or from one of the refurb divisions) covered the center drain hole with a refurb sticker, and the inside did show evidence of a minor spill. Fingers crossed that ~$250 and some hot air work will bring this $1,200 laptop back to life. I guess my luxurious YouTube career will have to wait *chuckles*.\nThinkpad X1 Extreme Gen. 2 bad battery and good INTEL CM246 chipset\nThinkpad X1 Extreme Gen. 2 blown CM246 chipset\nFebruary 20, 2023 The truth about soldering laptop chipsets Lots of bravado with puffed out chest regarding my soldering prowess. Some engineer decided to play a prank on me and add some components to the bottom of the board underneath the chipset. I\u0026rsquo;m not a surgeon, or a doctor, or someone that knows how to solder all that well, so ah, that\u0026rsquo;s not happening.\nCan\u0026rsquo;t even use a soldering hot plate, and the solder balls under the chip cover the entire chip, so I doubt hot air will work the way I imagined. And since the C THING has brought down prices on laptops due to more people working remotely, a used replacement motherboard is the same price as a Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3. I have some decisions to make, and none of which involve attempting to pour more money in to this very dead laptop.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still not sure whether or not I allowed enough time for the alcohol to dry when I was cleaning up the motherboard in preparation for solder paste. What are the chances of a two year old mosfet going bad? I\u0026rsquo;d imagine a very slim chance. So unless the battery was bad enough to cause the issue, I probably fried the laptop. Thankfully the laptop technically paid for itself before I killed it, so that\u0026rsquo;s nice *chuckles nervously*.\nFebruary 22, 2023 The Swinging Vine Farm I don\u0026rsquo;t have much to say in this entry. Just an excuse to maybe inspire a certain web comic to feature a Swinging Vine Farm. The only comic with the stones to skip the Tarzan motif. We all know a British person could never survive on jungle water. It would be irresponsible to assume otherwise.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t care to receive credit for the idea\u0026ndash;just really want to read the comic\u0026ndash;of a Swinging Vine Farm. Or the inclusion of a Swinging Vine Farm\u0026hellip;\nFebruary 24, 2023 Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut paste I reapplied thermal paste for the server/workstation CPU and GPU, and nothing blew up.\nAlso, 🔗 this SMBC comic. Sasquatch pee in the water was way better than a Swinging Vine Farm. I seriously doubt this blog influenced that comic strip, but I LOL\u0026rsquo;d, and sharing is caring.\nAlright, that\u0026rsquo;ll do it for a while.

If so, then this website layout may change again in the future. Super stoked how the collapsible menus look. That was my reasoning behind picking the 🔗 Geekdocs theme. Also added a spot to share random music hosted on YouTube. As I update my CD collection I\u0026rsquo;ll share more songs. CDs are so much easier to deal with compared to vinyl\u0026ndash;I can\u0026rsquo;t tell the difference between .mp3 and .flac formats anyway. This lil blog is also a way for me to keep my social media accounts and post elsewhere. Wait out the ad-pocalpyse over in this little corner of cyberspace and whatnot.\nJanuary 13, 2023 Legacy WinXP devices via modern PCs A few years ago I built a persistent Arch Linux system to run off a USB drive. I needed a way to connect a VCR2DVD device with drivers only for Windows XP to a modern computer. Why not Windows XP from a USB drive? It boots to Linux, and loads a virtualized copy of Windows XP with physical access to modern USB ports. And now it\u0026rsquo;s time to build the system again (it\u0026rsquo;s not for me). Why not build it and talk about it when it\u0026rsquo;s finished? Extra motivation to document the process and finish it in the next week or two I guess?\nJanuary 16, 2023 Less personal posts, and more technical posts Hwhat?\nBooting Arch Linux off a USB drive with a specific laptop is not going all that well. It\u0026rsquo;s funny how much things change in only a few years. If only I knew what I did two years ago to make it all work. WinXP legacy devices.. Tried Debian stable earlier, and now trying Ubuntu 22.04 Server. If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work I\u0026rsquo;ll look at other options. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep the too much information (TMI) blog posts up, because there\u0026rsquo;s no one to spray me with a garden hose.\nJanuary 17, 2023 Spelling and Grammar I guess it all depends on your perspective. I know I can do better, and I\u0026rsquo;ll try my darndedest. I really want ArchXP to be a thing. How cool would that be? Not cool at all but still. Arch Linux, USB drive, sometime in the next year. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\nFishing and PFAS 🔗 Eating one wild fish same as month of drinking [PFAS] tainted water: study\n🔗 U.S. Fish \u0026amp; Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuges System: ECDMS4Wildlife \u0026amp; Environmental Contaminants Mapper\nThis is why we can\u0026rsquo;t have nice wild caught fish for dinner.\nJanuary 18, 2023 Music Blog Posts Just for fun. Most are from my own collection, and addressing the Samurai Champloo Music Record entry: I just like the music. When I first watched the Samurai Champloo series, I was buying vinyl records from the Definitive Jux record label. Nujabes fit the style of music I was diving in to at the time and really encouraged me in to become a fan of the anime.\nJanuary 19, 2023 Github-Pages Test Added a new bug report for the markdown formatting mess. I also configured Visual Studio Code with Github markdown extension. It\u0026rsquo;ll be a little bit, but I doubt that more than 13 people visit this site, so in theory few will be affected as I break the website in the process. I\u0026rsquo;m just guessing, I have no accurate way to tell who is viewing what on the website. Consistent cloning though, so that\u0026rsquo;s cool.\nGithub-Pages Success I updated the Music Blog with a song from an American band I\u0026rsquo;ve appreciated since the early 00s, and deployment (converting markdown to HTML) failed. Deployments continued to fail until I removed the name of a certain country that just happens to be part of the band name. Post rock? I like guitar sounds. Which reminds me: 🔗 YouTube | Ronald Jenkees - Guitar Sound. I guess github-pages also scrapes and analyzes website link titles, because it kept failing until I removed the YouTube link to the song (Death Rides a Horse). I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a fan of the \u0026lsquo;underdogs\u0026rsquo;, so I hope it\u0026rsquo;s clear that I do not support what\u0026rsquo;s happening\u0026ndash;I just didn\u0026rsquo;t expect github-pages to be so selective.\nJanuary 20, 2023 IRL Designs blog Everything is a blog or Vlog these days c\u0026rsquo;mon. I made some stuff in the past two years, so I thought why not include them as well right? Two can be printed (STLs included), one can be casted, and the other can be purchased. RPi4 Console parts list not included because the configuration zapped my official 7in RPi LCD screen. So it goes. The Day \u0026amp; Night title of this blog subsection has little to do with the lyrics of the Kid Cudi song Day \u0026lsquo;N\u0026rsquo; Night. I do like the beat and atmosphere of that song though.\nJanuary 26, 2023 The Tunnel I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a moment to be brutally honest with myself for all the public to see. I have no job. No career. No five year plan. No job references. No letter of recommendation. No vehicle. I\u0026rsquo;m staying in a family member\u0026rsquo;s storage room an hour away from the city I know. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid of parties. I\u0026rsquo;m 38, and I have no friends. Also, I\u0026rsquo;m not as good as a writer as I once thought. What I do have going for me is that I stopped drinking wine and vaping cannabis several months ago, and I don\u0026rsquo;t buy snacks, energy drinks, or fast food. When I worked retail I needed two energy drinks (red bull) a day just to keep up with appearances. Now I drink tea or coffee (when I can afford unroasted beans). I\u0026rsquo;m also making just enough with \u0026lsquo;side hustles\u0026rsquo; to pay my bills. I\u0026rsquo;d like to pursue a career as a cloud architect, though my work history, personality, and reputation say otherwise. There we go, mask off, and neck revealed.\nJanuary 27, 2023 Professionalism I have Visual Studio Code configured with Vim emulation and the markdown renderer set for 🔗 Github Flavored Markdown (GFM). I guess it\u0026rsquo;s time to start working on the markdown formatting of this website. Probably didn\u0026rsquo;t have to file a bug report, but it\u0026rsquo;s decent practice.\nCreated: 01/13/2023 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":202,"href":"/Blog/stuff/2023/silicone_wrist_rests/","title":"🛠️ Casting Silicone (2020)","parent":"🛠️ Projects","content":" Supplies delivered: March 3, 2020\nI\u0026rsquo;ll try my best to keep these posts to the point and to not go crazy with the details. At the end of 2020 I stumbled in to some remote contract work. This job required the use of a keyboard, and a lot of typing. Instead of spending time and money on future RSI surgeries, I decided to get an urklenomic keyboard. The problem with the keyboard I bought (aside from the price tag) was that my wrists would go numb after four hours. Not as urklenomic as I\u0026rsquo;d like. The thin sponge wrist rests sold by the company did not help. That\u0026rsquo;s why I made these.\nThe silicone is too soft. I used Ecoflex 00-10 from Smooth-On (commonly used to make shoe insoles), and mixed in some sparkly black mica powder. After about a year the silicone began to flake away from the surface of the wrist rests. Still easier to clean than any other option on the market. Version #2 will be a medium durometer silicone, and the shape of the wrist rests will be less half a fudge brownie and more of a full keyboard sized shape. The plan is to carve the shape (or master) out of walnut. When casting silicone with silicone it\u0026rsquo;s best to use a durometer that\u0026rsquo;s squishier than the mold. Otherwise they\u0026rsquo;ll fuse together. And no, I have no intention of making anything other than tax deductible office products. Maybe fishing lures. Though I\u0026rsquo;d use a biodegradable plastisol instead of silicone for lures.\nCreated: 01/20/2023 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":203,"href":"/Blog/stuff/2023/rpi4console/","title":"🛠️ RPi4 Console (2021)","parent":"🛠️ Projects","content":" Pieced together: June 7, 2021\nRPi4 = Raspberry Pi 4\nI wanted a tiny console to check out ARM architecture stuff: Ubuntu/RPi4, and RetroPie/RPi4.\nThis one does not include a parts list because this configuration (power delivery hat/addon) killed the official RPi4 LCD screen.

It was a time of great technological upheaval, and a time of great technological waste. Many were upgrading to new systems, including private and public schools. Trent Reznor was one of the newest musical talents to have music videos, Quake the computer game had only been out a few years, and Intel Pentium II \u0026amp; III machines were tossed away in favor of laptops and more portable desktop computers.\nActually, a lot were tossed because the internet was fresh, and lightly dusted with viruses and malware. Good hard disk drives with some years left bogged down by a lot of bad late night decisions. McAfee Stinger was a favorite of mine. Use it to scan for infected files, find the infected files, and slowly replace them with uninfected files pulled and scanned from the WWW. ClamAV is better IMO.\nThe dumpsters by the storage units generally had non-perishable waste receptacles. The same types rented for deck or fence removal. So climbing into them was a smart idea right? Anyway, with bro\u0026rsquo;s help and guidance we came across a few desktop towers, one confirmed working monitor, and it was time to get to work.\nI ended up with a Pentium III system running Windows 95. It could run Quake, what else did I need it for at the age of 14? And it had a CD-ROM drive, so I could listen to those sweet Nine Inch Nail jams.

Our family dog (black labrador) had a litter of puppies, and I was tasked to care for them (which included shoveling). So, for a few months I moved around dog food, filled bowls, and crawled into the makeshift puppy kennel in our backyard to complete my daily waste extraction quest. Hawthorne, Florida circa early 90s. I believe I was payed $10 a week\u0026ndash;not sure about those details\u0026ndash;it was a little while ago.\nThe kennel was about double puppy height, because my dog Ninja learned that he could climb the chicken wire fence. With that knew discovery, Dad created the perfect puppy ambush box made of chicken wire (ambushed by puppy kisses everyday). I wanted to save for a Super Nintendo, and Dad said he would hold on to the money. \u0026ldquo;The lawn won\u0026rsquo;t mow itself.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Put shit in one hand, and WANT in another, and what do you get?\u0026rdquo;\nWouldn\u0026rsquo;t you know it, around the same time all the puppies were adopted, a new beer brewing kit appeared in the house. I worked a few paying \u0026lsquo;jobs\u0026rsquo; before I got a real job at the age of 15, but that first job stung a little. Dad was awesome when his pain levels were tolerable. He worked so hard that some of the rubber parts in his spine wore away. Alcohol probably eased the pain, but definitely wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best solution. Well, a bad solution to a problem that the military said wasn\u0026rsquo;t due to his two decades of service. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have things. Oh I had things. It\u0026rsquo;s just\u0026ndash;this is something I was working towards. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine there was a lot of shitty laundry to do too (ba dum tss).\nI\u0026rsquo;m two years away from 40 now\u0026ndash;which is fine\u0026ndash;we all move out our own pace.

The kid\u0026ndash;I wish I could remember his name\u0026ndash;for some reason was absent for a few days. Obviously, I felt guilty for being so damn mean. I liked Spider-Man and Superman. I probably would have even liked Aquaman had I known of that superhero. At Shell Elementary school, even though there was an intercom system, some of the news was announced by our teachers. The teacher said that the boy dropped his books as he and his Mom were crossing the road, and his decision to retrieve his books without looking out for traffic ended his life.\nI loved books (still love books). I don\u0026rsquo;t fall into another world as I read fiction like I did before, but I use to be completely immersed in the stories. I mean, in first grade I wasn\u0026rsquo;t reading novels, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t need the pictures to visualize what was happening. We had something in common, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get past the Superman vs. Spider-Man argument. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that he died to make me nicer. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that this tragic event had to happen for my benefit. In my opinion that\u0026rsquo;s completely asinine. However, I did take meaning from what happened. It took a few decades for me to realize that I was not to blame. No one was to blame. It was a tragic accident.\nI feel like I may have made amends as I progressed through to high school and in to the real world. When people spoke to me I listened, and I tried to be as accommodating as possible. In my twenties, as a shift manager at CVS, part of my duty was to shift the direction of shouting customers away from other associates on towards myself. And as everyone knows, when someone has to wait an extended period of time for their medication, they have a lot of frustration to offload. Some of them would thank me for letting them vent. Even though \u0026lsquo;venting\u0026rsquo; consisted of them yelling in my face. It was something I developed over time that took a lot of patience and careful attuning to the issues at hand. I try my best to make things right if possible. And if that means swallowing my pride for a little while, then so be it. I can\u0026rsquo;t let that happen again.\nSeptember 5, 2022 Coupé de ville I seriously doubt my ole 1985 Caddy is still in service\nI was new to the feeling of driving a floating boat of a Cadillac. I believe I worked truck @ CVS that morning, which meant coming in at 3am and getting off at 3pm. Blessed vinyl extraordinaire along for the ride for some reason. We were driving south on 441 just past GHS, about to take a right on to 16th ave.. Not swerving, but no power steering made it difficult to drive super straight. Blue and red flashed in my rear view mirror. I pull into a Citgo gas station parking space and realized my lights were shining through the Citgo building window, so I turned my headlights off. The people that owned the place were always nice to my friends and I, so at least I could return the favor.\nMr. Officer decided it was DUI time, so he asked me to get out and do some of those perfectly accurate physical sobriety tests. Blessed vinyl extraordinaire asked to speak with Mr. Officer privately. I have no idea what was said between them, but after a few minutes I was given a ticket for driving without headlights, and was told my friend would have to drive home\u0026ndash;which was only several hundred feet away. Had he not been along for the ride, I would have spent at least a few nights in jail (thank you).\nSo, that\u0026rsquo;s the end of the story right? I paid the $80 ticket for being a skater type and driving a purple Cadillac while mildly tired, and all was well. Nope. You see, I paid with a check. The check was sent back, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of this until there was a notice in the mail stating that my license was suspended. This was during a time when only money orders were the only acceptable payment method for tickets. Ok, this had to have been a mistake right? My first ticket, and this happens. I hired a lawyer to appear in court and save my bacon. On court day I drove to a Broward County courtroom. Within the first 30 minutes of sitting among an auditorium of people waiting for their mini trials, I watched a young and intelligent man get charged with years of jail for selling a small amount of weed. I was waiting maybe an hour before my turn. I stepped up in front of the judge\u0026ndash;my lawyer took one look at me and said one word, \u0026ldquo;guilty\u0026rdquo;, to the judge. The car was impounded six months previously because it was towed before I could get it fixed. And I paid an additional $350 afterwards because Mr. Officer was being a Mr. Officer.\nI used a cassette tape to stereo plug adapter with my RCA Lyra rd1071 MP3 player to play tunes through the Bose speakers. And wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you know it, the door of the MP3 player battery compartment was held shut with a piece of duct tape. A year earlier the player flew out of my pocket while I was riding my bike up and down 16th avenue. In fact, the road was so steep, one time my Suntour back derailleur derailed itself onto the sidewalk. Anyway, the player was loaded with songs from The White Stripes (Elephant), Boards of Canada (Music has the Right to Children), Dragonforce (Inhuman Rampage), and Ratatat (Ratatat \u0026amp; Classics). Probably more, but back then an SD card only held so many MP3s (1-2GB).\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know how many times I\u0026rsquo;ve heard the sentence, \u0026ldquo;Have you ever been arrested before?\u0026rdquo; But I\u0026rsquo;ll take that over another pat down anyday shivers. To be clear, it\u0026rsquo;s been 13 years since my last ticket, my driver\u0026rsquo;s license is in good standing, and I always have proof of insurance. When pulled over in the future, the only thing I\u0026rsquo;ll switch off is my windshield wipers.\nSeptember 6, 2022 High school drafting class. This one hurt my psyche quite a bit Pages of ideas in the local Nextcloud instance tho\nOk, granted, this was about twenty years ago, but I still think about it from time to time. My folks smoked cigarettes to cut through the monotony of the day to day grind. And they smoked in the house, ergo, I smelled like smoke. This was during the period in my life when I moved in with my then girlfriend and her family because Vietnam War reasons. So, at the start of my drafting class, I smelled like smoke. And my drafting teacher assumed I smoked my breakfast before class. She said this to me while confiscating my Tech Deck. I think she meant that I was too skinny, and picked up a bad habit at an early age. She also liked to call me urchin in front of the class. Which basically means street rat or hedgehog. I ate what was available to me, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t smoke cigarettes. But I did like to skate, which I guess was 75% of why she said that.\nAt some point I realized that I was going to get a D in the class if I don\u0026rsquo;t take advantage of the extra credit assignment. She loved to scoff at my work for the rest of the class to take notice, and when I asked what was wrong, she would ignore me and continue to the next student. The extra credit assignment was literally my favorite part of that class, which was to design a vehicle using four wheels powered by a rubber band propeller. We were limited to a sheet of foam board, scissors, and tape/glue. I won\u0026rsquo;t name who my teacher grouped me with (now an architect? idk). He probably never had to use his hands for much, which I should have taken into account before I started the design process. I had seen a few prototype car videos, so I decided to create a curved design for the least amount of wind resistance. And the propeller in a push configuration instead of a pull configuration. It sort of looked like a cross between a delta wing and a prototype sports car. Only with a big rubber band powered propeller on the back.\nOnce the design was finished, I tasked my partner with cutting out all the pieces\u0026ndash;not very neighborly of me. Once completed, I assembled the car, and he complained to our drafting teacher because his hand was sore. He probably thought it would have been the other way around. I had done odd jobs since I was seven, so I had no sense of what others of my age group considered too difficult. Maybe I should have spent less time talking with a friend, and included my partner in the design process. I believe there was a physical line to cross to gain extra credit, and there was a contest to see which vehicle could go the farthest. Our car won (x2 the distance of 2nd place). So, extra credit right? Well, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you know it, the designer and builder of the car did not get the extra credit, and failed that class. Had my teacher listened to my side of the story, would I have been an industrial designer? No, probably not. But still, what hell.\nSeptember 8, 2022 From when I worked at United Tote One of my 2009 United Tote pay stubs\nUnited Tote was/is the parimutuel wagering vendor of Pompano Park, Pompano Beach, Florida. All day yesterday the \u0026ldquo;silly ol\u0026rsquo; Winniee the Poooh\u0026rdquo; part of the The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh theme song played in my head. And so, here\u0026rsquo;s another long winded story. Operators showed up for the early morning shift or for the overnight shift. Technicians worked the overnight shift. As an operator, the start of our day involved double checking the live race card (harness race track). If a horse was scratched\u0026ndash;removed from the race\u0026ndash;then changes needed to be made by an operator, so that no one places an impossible bet. As an operator of the morning shift, we performed a lot of the easy technician duties. If someone punched a screen and cracked it, we were called to replace it. But most of our day was spent changing out rolls of self checkout wagering machine paper. Occasionally, we needed to cancel a stolen ticket, or work with track management to figure out something to do with someone\u0026rsquo;s players club card (VIP card). Cards were stolen, and bets made illegally were cancelled. Technicians knew quite a bit more about the machines, so main board changes and such were left for when the technicians arrived for their shifts.\nThe tough calls were for jammed bills. Those required a key from park employees\nAfter about six months of working in the TOTE room, one of the technicians went on vacation for a month. My boss at the time asked me if I would like to take the overnight tech shift for some overtime. I enjoy learning how things work, and I guess I was good enough at documenting work performed that I was asked to work the extra shifts. At the time, I had very little since my move to South Florida. All my stuff was back in Gainesville, FL, and my last car was probably sold for scrap from one of the impound lots a few months before I moved (Caddy). Ninety hour work weeks were tough, but I needed a car, and had trouble with impulse spending. At the time there was a thriving karaoke culture in South Florida, and was somewhat addictive and expensive. Thirteen years later and I still remember the majority of the lyrics from my songs. Anyway, so I came in as an operator in the morning, and left as a technician the following morning. A little bit of sleep, and back to work again. Unfortunately, my relationship did not survive the overtime opportunity. Actually it was fortunate, because we weren\u0026rsquo;t right for each other. She was lonely, and I was doing my best to save for a car and pay my half of everything. There was a Hungry Howies close by that had that cheeseburger pizza. I quickly realized my favorite fast food pizza place. Later I would learn that their Hawaiian pizza is even better. I grew up with pineapple on ham casserole things.\nHungry Howies cheeseburger pizza or pineapple pizza and HBO.\nOne of the folks that worked directly with the track (TOTE was a permanent vendor) once called me Christopher Robin, because our manager had a tattoo of Eore, and I had a way of of avoiding the trouble that our manager and the other employees got into outside of work. The name of the guy that called me Christopher Robin was Joe. I believe he was an announcer for live race days. He was one of the few people that spoke to me without a condescending tone in his voice. Which I appreciated. Even though the machines were from the late 80s or early 90s, it was the first job in which I felt I was using my natural aptitude. Which was rewarding. The place was kind of depressing though. Termites made it so that entire floors were out of order. Not a lot of smiling faces either. Quite a change from my humble beginnings in Hawthorne/Gainesville, FL. I never placed a wager too, so I was kind of on the outside looking inward.\nSeptember 18, 2022 Too ambitious to be a bench warmer I like to keep a baseball around as a reminder\nThis one is from 1995 (I was 11). Which wasn\u0026rsquo;t that long ago. I have a confession to make. I played two years of little league baseball, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t hit the ball. It didn\u0026rsquo;t matter who pitched\u0026ndash;whether or not I crowded the plate or did the opposite\u0026ndash;I was either walked to first base, struck out, or was caught looking at all three strikes. Naturally, when my team was at bat, coach (all of them) put me on the bench. The baseball fields were often next to racquet ball courts (perfect for wall ball), and sometimes playgrounds.\nI probably would have fielded more balls with a boy\u0026rsquo;s sized glove too\nIt was nearly impossible to make me sit on a bench when I was surrounded by so much fun. Our team was up to bat, and I was off the bench on a solo adventure. Was it an all star game? I guess that\u0026rsquo;s not important. Near a small building a few dozen feet away from the bleachers, I hear a voice. It\u0026rsquo;s odd that I would tune in to one voice out of all the yelling coming from proud parents, and random kids playing, but her voice was different. \u0026ldquo;Why wont anyone play with me?!\u0026rdquo; The resignation in her voice combined with the near lack of a southern accent was what really caught my attention. As a kid once with a slight British accent adapted from preschool in Bermuda, I knew what it was like to be an outsider in North Central Florida. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but ask her if she wanted to play catch. \u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t have a glove.\u0026rdquo; I believe she said. A few under hand throws later, and our attention shifted to the pull up bars nearby. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember much other than showing her how to penny drop, because unfortunately, our time was cut short. A man from near the bleachers was calling her name. By the tone of his voice, she was in trouble, and he was most likely a legal guardian. It was obviously time for her to go. I believe she said \u0026ldquo;thank you\u0026rdquo;, and we both went our separate ways.\nHave I seen her since then? I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure, but I\u0026rsquo;m thankful that something good came out of my inability to hit a baseball.\nCreated: 01/10/2023 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":207,"href":"/Blog/daynight/2022/0822/","title":"📁 08-22","parent":"📁 2022","content":" August 9, 2022 My wildling side.

In the grand scheme of things, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t that long ago The mobile home still visible to the left of the red and gray building was where I lived with my folks from 1997-2001.\nMy folks lost their home in Hawthorne, FL (where I learned to respect nature 1989-1996\u0026ndash;snakes), and moved to Gainesville, FL. My old room window is visible in the photo above. That red and gray building was a local pub (12pm-2am). My Dad had a Vietnam War problem, but wouldn\u0026rsquo;t admit it, and so I moved out to share a room in an apartment within the same city when I was sixteen. I\u0026rsquo;d rather not talk about how I moved\u0026ndash;it was a mutual decision, and I graduated on time (barely).\nStorm drain guard rail on the right marks the spot where the school bus picked us up in the morning.\nI sat on that storm drain guard rail while others sat on the concrete bus bench a few dozen yards to the right. The convenience store/gas station to the left of that railing was robbed four times under the same management. One morning a girl attempted to stab another girl one just after Ms. Dallas (our bus driver I think?) picked us up. One of the chill middle school guys offering to share a joint. \u0026ldquo;Nah, I\u0026rsquo;m good man.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You sure?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo; Lots of bass booming vehicles passing through that area in the morning. For some reason in 2005, (perhaps because they reminded me of \u0026rsquo;the old neighborhood\u0026rsquo;) I tried Black \u0026amp; Mild cigars (such an iconic smell).\nIf I could go back in time, I\u0026rsquo;d stop myself from wasting so much money on tobacco products\nLocal rowdy middle school boys found out I was decent at basketball at the mobile parks\u0026rsquo; basketball court, and so they attempted to initiate me as part of their roaming bicycle group. I admired John Stockton back then for some reason (so many elbows..). Same rowdy boys that used the emergency exit of the school bus when we got stuck one morning. Same ones that made fun of me for practicing freestyle tricks on a skateboard (ironically before I learned of Rodney Mullen).\nAs I sat on that storm drain guard rail (probably while wearing my Goosebumps tie dyed t-shirt) one of them smashed an egg on my head. My guess was that the big guy was itching to fight someone, and my leave me alone face was bugging him. So with egg dripping down my face he asked me, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not mad?\u0026rdquo; I responded with a soft but stern, \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo; What they didn\u0026rsquo;t see is me walking back home to take a shower, and my Dad calling my Mom from work so that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t miss a day of school. They didn\u0026rsquo;t bother me much after that.\nThe positive side was that before moving to Gainesville, FL, I had no general sense of modern skateboarding. What I knew came from 1980s how to skateboard books. Kickflip? I knew more about what lived in Florida swamps and fishing than skateboarding. My first deck was actually a Status shop board (~$35). Probably bought it from Play It Again Sports.\nMy first pro model deck. I believe was a 2001 Kerry Getz Habitat board (~$55)\nAugust 11, 2022 The day a soccer goal chose violence My conscious keeps saying the world needs to know, and so here I am again.\nI was wearing a corduroy golf cap (Andy Capp style) turned backwards. It was hot. We were riding bikes on a soccer field (1997). As a former builder of makeshift launch ramps I needed excitement, so I thought riding through a soccer goal would be fun.\nThe soccer goal (mid-left) closest to the fire station was where it happened\nThe first soccer goal on the far left side of the field (not shown) did not have sidebars, and so I didn\u0026rsquo;t inspect the one ahead of where I was going. Obviously, the goal next to the fire station had sidebars (mid height stabilizer bars on each side). One moment I was riding my bike, the next moment I was picking my self off the ground and picking up one of my front teeth at the same time, \u0026ldquo;Hey guys! I lost a tooth!\u0026rdquo; My twelve year old self had lost about six years of time in a few seconds. My voice was reflected this fact. I knew to keep it in a cup of milk, but my concussion made it difficult to convey why that was important. A parent of one of my friends pointed to my hat and said something like, \u0026ldquo;Chris! You\u0026rsquo;re bleeding!\u0026rdquo;\nDefinitely ruined the nice golf hat from a recent birthday. I rinsed my mouth using the faucet on the side of the 20th Ave. fire station (we lived across the street, and yes it was loud), and I chuckled along with the doctor while he stitched me up at the local clinic. The other tooth was removed by a dentist for other reasons when I was in my twenties. Ok, hopefully that\u0026rsquo;s all the storytime I have for a while.\nPhoto of the scar from 2022 (right above the cyclops forehead ridge)\nCreated: 01/10/2023 • Edited: 02/09/2025 • Author: Chris Schammert (csmertx) • History 🕵️ "},{"id":208,"href":"/pad/","title":"🗒️ No Ads.
